Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 ya ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls9 ws0">church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 yb ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa ws0">sacristy had once stood.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 yc ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb ws0"> He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 yd ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc ws0">then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night. There were no</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 ye ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd ws0">wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 yf ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse ws0">entire next day searching for it.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y10 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf ws0"> He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y11 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls10 ws0">He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y12 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls11 ws0">comfortable pillows.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y13 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls12 ws0"> It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars through the half-destroyed roof.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y14 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls13 ws0"> I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream that night as a week ago, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y15 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14 ws0">once again he had awakened before it ended.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y16 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15 ws0"> He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept. He had noticed that, as</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y17 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls16 ws0">soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y18 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls17 ws0">life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them through the countryside</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y19 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18 ws0">in search of food and water. &quot;They are so used to me that they know my schedule,&quot; he muttered.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y1a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19 ws0">Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he who</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y1b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a ws0">had become accustomed to<span class="_ _0"></span><span class="ff3 ls1b">their<span class="_ _0"></span></span><span class="ls1c"> schedule.</span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y1c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d ws0"> But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy prodded them, one by one,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y1d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e ws0">with his crook, calling each by name. He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y1e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f ws0">what he said. So there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impression on</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y1f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls20 ws0">him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y20 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls21 ws0">he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
<div id="pf2" class="pf w0 h0" data-page-no="2"><div class="pc pc2 w0 h0"><img class="bi x0 y0 w1 h1" alt="" src="bg2.png"/><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y21 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22 ws0"> But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the girl, the daughter of a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls23 ws0">merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls24 ws0">once, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls25 ws0">that the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the boy</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls26 ws0">about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls28 ws0"> &quot;I need to sell some wool,&quot; the boy told the merchant.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls29 ws0"> The shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon. So the boy sat on the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a ws0">steps of the shop and took a book from his bag.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2b ws0"> &quot;I didn&apos;t know shepherds knew how to read,&quot; said a girl&apos;s voice behind him.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c ws0"> The girl was typical of the region ofAndalusia , with flowing black hair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2d ws0">Moorish conquerors.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2e ws0"> &quot;Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books,&quot; he answered. During the two hours that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2f ws0">they talked, she told him she was the merchant&apos;s daughter, and spoke of life in the village, where each</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls30 ws0">day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the Andalusian countryside, and related the news</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls31 ws0">from the other towns where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls32 ws0"> &quot;How did you learn to read?&quot; the girl asked at one point.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls33 ws0"> &quot;Like everybody learns,&quot; he said. &quot;In school.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls30 ws0"> &quot;Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls34 ws0"> The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question. He was sure the girl</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls35 ws0">would never understand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls36 ws0">wide with fear and surprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls37 ws0">end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days. He recognized that he was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls38 ws0">feeling something he had never experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls39 ws0">with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3a ws0"> But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep. He paid for the wool and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3b ws0">asked the shepherd to come back the following year.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3c ws0"> And now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village. He was excited, and at the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d ws0">same time uneasy: maybe the girl had already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e ws0">their wool.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f ws0"> &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter,&quot; he said to his sheep. &quot;I know other girls in other places.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls40 ws0"> But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that shepherds, like seamen and like traveling</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls30 ws0">salesmen, always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls41 ws0">carefree wandering.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
<div id="pf3" class="pf w0 h0" data-page-no="3"><div class="pc pc3 w0 h0"><img class="bi x0 y0 w1 h1" alt="" src="bg3.png"/><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y21 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls42 ws0"> The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun. They never have to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls43 ws0">make any decisions, he thought. Maybe that&apos;s why they always stay close to me.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls44 ws0"> The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy knew how to find the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls45 ws0">best pastures inAndalusia , they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls46 ws0">seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls47 ws0">and didn&apos;t understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls48 ws0">food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and—once in a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls49 ws0">while—their meat.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4a ws0"> If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, they would become aware only after</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4b ws0">most of the flock had been slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they&apos;ve forgotten how to rely</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4c ws0">on their own instincts, because I lead them to nourishment.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4d ws0"> The boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the sycamore growing from within, had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4e ws0">been haunted. It had caused him to have the same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse ws0">feel anger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit from the wine that remained from his dinner of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4f ws0">the night before, and he gathered his jacket closer to his body. He knew that a few hours from now, with</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls50 ws0">the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls51 ws0">fields. It was the time of day when all ofSpain slept during the summer. The heat lasted until nightfall, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls52 ws0">all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when he thought to complain about the burden of its weight,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls53 ws0">he remembered that, because he had the jacket, he had withstood the cold of the dawn.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls54 ws0"> We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for the jacket&apos;s weight and warmth.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls55 ws0"> The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to travel, and, after two years of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls56 ws0">walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls57 ws0">explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read. That he had attended a seminary</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls58 ws0">until he was sixteen. His parents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of pride for a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls59 ws0">simple farm family. They worked hard just to have food and water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5a ws0">Spanish, and theology. But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted to know the world, and this</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5b ws0">was much more important to him than knowing God and learning about man&apos;s sins. One afternoon, on a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5c ws0">visit to his family, he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he didn&apos;t want to become a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5d ws0">priest. That he wanted to travel.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5e ws0"> &quot;People from all over the world have passed through this village, son,&quot; said his father. &quot;They come in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5f ws0">search of new things, but when they leave they are basically the same people they were when they</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls60 ws0">arrived. They climb the mountain to see the castle, and they wind up thinking that the past was better than</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls61 ws0">what we have now. They have blond hair, or dark skin, but basically they&apos;re the same as the people who</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls62 ws0">live right here.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls63 ws0"> &quot;But I&apos;d like to see the castles in the towns where they live,&quot; the boy explained.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls64 ws0"> &quot;Those people, when they see our land, say that they would like to live here forever,&quot; his father</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls65 ws0">continued.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls66 ws0"> &quot;Well, I&apos;d like to see their land, and see how they live,&quot; said his son.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
<div id="pf4" class="pf w0 h0" data-page-no="4"><div class="pc pc4 w0 h0"><img class="bi x0 y0 w1 h1" alt="" src="bg4.png"/><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls67 ws0"> &quot;The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so they can afford to travel,&quot; his father said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y21 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls68 ws0">&quot;Amongst us, the only ones who travel are the shepherds.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls69 ws0"> &quot;Well, then I&apos;ll be a shepherd!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls6a ws0"> His father said no more. The next day, he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient Spanish gold</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls6b ws0">coins.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls6c ws0"> &quot;I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of your inheritance. But use them to buy</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls6d ws0">your flock. Take to the fields, and someday you&apos;ll learn that our countryside is the best, and our women</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls6e ws0">the most beautiful.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls6f ws0"> And he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his father&apos;s gaze a desire to be able, himself, to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls70 ws0">travel the world—a desire that was still alive, despite his father&apos;s having had to bury it, over dozens of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls71 ws0">years, under the burden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls72 ws0">night of his life.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls73 ws0"> The horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared. The boy thought back to that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls74 ws0">conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had already seen many castles and met many women (but</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls75 ws0">none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls76 ws0">could trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to live out his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls77 ws0">dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls78 ws0">had had enough of the sea, he would already have known other cities, other women, and other chances</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls79 ws0">to be happy. I couldn&apos;t have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls7a ws0"> Whenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He had never been to that ruined church before,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls7b ws0">in spite of having traveled through those parts many times. The world was huge and inexhaustible; he had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls7c ws0">only to allow his sheep to set the route for a while, and he would discover other interesting things. The</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls7d ws0">problem is that they don&apos;t even realize that they&apos;re walking a new road every day. They don&apos;t see that the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls7e ws0">fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls7f ws0"> Maybe we&apos;re all that way, the boy mused. Even me—I haven&apos;t thought of other women since I met the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls28 ws0">merchant&apos;s daughter. Looking at the sun, he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before midday. There,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls80 ws0">he could exchange his book for a thicker one, fill his wine bottle, shave, and have a haircut; he had to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls81 ws0">prepare himself for his meeting with the girl, and he didn&apos;t want to think about the possibility that some</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls82 ws0">other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep, had arrived there before him and asked for her hand.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls83 ws0"> It&apos;s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting, he thought, as he looked again</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls84 ws0">at the position of the sun, and hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa, there was an</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls85 ws0">old woman who interpreted dreams.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls76 ws0"> The old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house; it was separated from her living room by</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls86 ws0">a curtain of colored beads. The room&apos;s furnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred Heart of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls87 ws0">Jesus, and two chairs.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls88 ws0"> The woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then she took both of his hands in hers, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls89 ws0">began quietly to pray.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
<div id="pf5" class="pf w0 h0" data-page-no="5"><div class="pc pc5 w0 h0"><img class="bi x0 y0 w1 h1" alt="" src="bg5.png"/><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y21 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8a ws0"> It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had experience on the road with Gypsies; they</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8b ws0">also traveled, but they had no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8c ws0">was also said that they had a pact with the devil, and that they kidnapped children and, taking them away</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8d ws0">to their mysterious camps, made them their slaves. As a child, the boy had always been frightened to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8e ws0">death that he would be captured by Gypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8f ws0">his hands in hers.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls90 ws0"> But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to reassure himself. He didn&apos;t want his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls91 ws0">hand to begin trembling, showing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our Father silently.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls92 ws0"> &quot;Very interesting,&quot; said the woman, never taking her eyes from the boy&apos;s hands, and then she fell silent.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls90 ws0"> The boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and the woman sensed it. He quickly</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls93 ws0">pulled his hands away.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls94 ws0"> &quot;I didn&apos;t come here to have you read my palm,&quot; he said, already regretting having come. He thought for a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls95 ws0">moment that it would be better to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing, that he was giving too</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls96 ws0">much importance to his recurrent dream.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls97 ws0"> &quot;You came so that you could learn about your dreams,&quot; said the old woman. &quot;And dreams are the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls98 ws0">language of God. When he speaks in our language, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls99 ws0">the language of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But, whichever it is, I&apos;m going to charge you</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls9a ws0">for the consultation.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls9b ws0"> Another trick, the boy thought. But he decided to take a chance. A shepherd always takes his chances</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls9c ws0">with wolves and with drought, and that&apos;s what makes a shepherd&apos;s life exciting.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls9d ws0"> &quot;I have had the same dream twice,&quot; he said. &quot;I dreamed that I was in a field with my sheep, when a child</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls9e ws0">appeared and began to play with the animals. I don&apos;t like people to do that, because the sheep are afraid</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls9f ws0">of strangers. But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them. I don&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa0 ws0">know why. I don&apos;t know how animals know the age of human beings.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa1 ws0"> &quot;Tell me more about your dream,&quot; said the woman. &quot;I have to get back to my cooking, and, since you</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d ws0">don&apos;t have much money, I can&apos;t give you a lot of time.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa2 ws0"> &quot;The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while,&quot; continued the boy, a bit upset. &quot;And</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa3 ws0">suddenly, the child took me by both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa4 ws0"> He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were. But she said</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa5 ws0">nothing.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa6 ws0"> &quot;Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,&quot;—he said the last three words slowly, so that the old woman would</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa7 ws0">understand—&quot;the child said to me, If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.&apos; And, just as she</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa8 ws0">was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both times.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa9 ws0"> The woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsaa ws0"> &quot;I&apos;m not going to charge you anything now,&quot; she said. &quot;But I want one-tenth of the treasure, if you find it.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsab ws0"> The boy laughed—out of happiness.

That&apos;s why I feel that I deserve a part of what you find.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb4 ws0"> &quot;And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in Egypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb5 ws0">was a child who showed them to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make you a rich</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb6 ws0">man.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb7 ws0"> The boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn&apos;t need to seek out the old woman for this! But then</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb8 ws0">he remembered that he wasn&apos;t going to have to pay anything.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb9 ws0"> &quot;I didn&apos;t need to waste my time just for this,&quot; he said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsba ws0"> &quot;I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It&apos;s the simple things in life that are the most</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsbb ws0">extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them. And since I am not wise, I have had to learn</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22 ws0">other arts, such as the reading of palms.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsbc ws0"> &quot;Well, how am I going to get to Egypt?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls39 ws0"> &quot;I only interpret dreams.

He remembered</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc1 ws0">that he had a number of things he had to take care of: he went to the market for something to eat, he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc2 ws0">traded his book for one that was thicker, and he found a bench in the plaza where he could sample the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc3 ws0">new wine he had bought. The day was hot, and the wine was refreshing. The sheep were at the gates of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8b ws0">the city, in a stable that belonged to a friend. The boy knew a lot of people in the city. That was what</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc4 ws0">made traveling appeal to him—he always made new friends, and he didn&apos;t need to spend all of his time</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc5 ws0">with them. When someone sees the same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc6 ws0">they wind up becoming a part of that person&apos;s life. And then they want the person to change. If someone</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc7 ws0">isn&apos;t what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc8 ws0">other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsad ws0"> He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc9 ws0">the fields. Three days from now, he would be with the merchant&apos;s daughter.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

On the very first page it described a burial ceremony. And</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y21 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lscb ws0">the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, he thought,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lscc ws0">he would present one person at a time, so that the reader wouldn&apos;t have to worry about memorizing a lot</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lscd ws0">of names.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsce ws0"> When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading, he liked the book better; the burial</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lscf ws0">was on a snowy day, and he welcomed the feeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat down at</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd0 ws0">his side and tried to strike up a conversation.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd1 ws0"> &quot;What are they doing?&quot; the old man asked, pointing at the people in the plaza.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd2 ws0"> &quot;Working,&quot; the boy answered dryly, making it look as if he wanted to concentrate on his reading.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd3 ws0"> Actually, he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the merchant&apos;s daughter, so that she could</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd4 ws0">see that he was someone who was capable of doing difficult things. He had already imagined the scene</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd5 ws0">many times; every time, the girl became fascinated when he explained that the sheep had to be sheared</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd6 ws0">from back to front. He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep. Most</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd7 ws0">of them he had read in books, but he would tell them as if they were from his personal experience. She</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd8 ws0">would never know the difference, because she didn&apos;t know how to read.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd9 ws0"> Meanwhile, the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation. He said that he was tired</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsda ws0">and thirsty, and asked if he might have a sip of the boy&apos;s wine. The boy offered his bottle, hoping that the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsdb ws0">old man would leave him alone.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsdc ws0"> But the old man wanted to talk, and he asked the boy what book he was reading. The boy was tempted</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsdd ws0">to be rude, and move to another bench, but his father had taught him to be respectful of the elderly. So</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsde ws0">he held out the book to the man—for two reasons: first, that he, himself, wasn&apos;t sure how to pronounce</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd0 ws0">the title; and second, that if the old man didn&apos;t know how to read, he would probably feel ashamed and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsdf ws0">decide of his own accord to change benches.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse0 ws0"> &quot;Hmm…&quot; said the old man, looking at all sides of the book, as if it were some strange object. &quot;This is an</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse1 ws0">important book, but it&apos;s really irritating.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse2 ws0"> The boy was shocked. The old man knew how to read, and had already read the book. And if the book</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse3 ws0">was irritating, as the old man had said, the boy still had time to change it for another.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lscb ws0"> &quot;It&apos;s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in the world say,&quot; continued the old man.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse4 ws0">&quot;It describes people&apos;s inability to choose their own destinies. And it ends up saying that everyone believes</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse5 ws0">the world&apos;s greatest lie.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse6 ws0"> &quot;What&apos;s the world&apos;s greatest lie?&quot; the boy asked, completely surprised.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse7 ws0"> &quot;It&apos;s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what&apos;s happening to us, and our lives</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse8 ws0">become controlled by fate. That&apos;s the world&apos;s greatest lie.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse9 ws0"> &quot;That&apos;s never happened to me,&quot; the boy said. &quot;They wanted me to be a priest, but I decided to become</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsea ws0">a shepherd.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lseb ws0"> &quot;Much better,&quot; said the old man. &quot;Because you really like to travel.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsec ws0"> &quot;He knew what I was thinking,&quot; the boy said to himself.

The boy noticed that the man&apos;s clothing was strange. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y21 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsee ws0">looked like an Arab, which was not unusual in those parts. Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa; one</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsef ws0">had only to cross the narrow straits by boat.

They tell their incredible stories at the time when</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsfd ws0">you want to hear them.

He read the name of the merchant&apos;s daughter, which he hadn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc8 ws0">even known, and he read things he had never told anyone.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls10c ws0"> &quot;I&apos;m the king of Salem,&quot; the old man had said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls10d ws0"> &quot;Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?&quot; the boy asked, awed and embarrassed.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lscb ws0"> &quot;For several reasons. But let&apos;s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls10e ws0">destiny.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd0 ws0"> The boy didn&apos;t know what a person&apos;s &quot;destiny&quot; was.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls10f ws0"> &quot;It&apos;s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls110 ws0">destiny is.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls111 ws0"> &quot;At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls112 ws0">and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls113 ws0">mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their destiny.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls114 ws0"> None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy. But he wanted to know what the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls115 ws0">&quot;mysterious force&quot; was; the merchant&apos;s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that!</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls116 ws0"> &quot;It&apos;s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to realize your destiny. It prepares</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls117 ws0">your spirit and your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls118 ws0">that you do, when you really want something, it&apos;s because that desire originated in the soul of the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsbe ws0">universe.

At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things to happen.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls78 ws0">There are other things I do, too, but most of the time people don&apos;t realize I&apos;ve done them.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls12e ws0"> The old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to appear before a miner, and had taken</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls12f ws0">the form of a stone. The miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls130 ws0">had been working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of thousands of stones looking for an</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls131 ws0">emerald.

Since the miner had sacrificed everything to his</span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls112 ws0">destiny, the old man decided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls135 ws0">the miner&apos;s foot. The miner, with all the anger and frustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls43 ws0">and threw it aside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it fell upon, and there,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls30 ws0">embedded in the broken stone, was the most beautiful emerald in the world.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls136 ws0"> &quot;People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,&quot; said the old man, with a certain</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls137 ws0">bitterness. &quot;Maybe that&apos;s why they give up on it so early, too.

He was tense and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls144 ws0">upset, because he knew that the old man was right. He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls145 ws0">bread, thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what the old man had said about him.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls146 ws0">Sometimes it&apos;s better to leave things as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing.

The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls149 ws0">baker. So he began to wander through the city, and found himself at the gates. There was a small building</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14a ws0">there, with a window at which people bought tickets to Africa. And he knew that Egypt was in Africa.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14b ws0"> &quot;Can I help you?&quot; asked the man behind the window.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14c ws0"> &quot;Maybe tomorrow,&quot; said the boy, moving away. If he sold just one of his sheep, he&apos;d have enough to get</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14d ws0">to the other shore of the strait. The idea frightened him.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14e ws0"> &quot;Another dreamer,&quot; said the ticket seller to his assistant, watching the boy walk away. &quot;He doesn&apos;t have</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14f ws0">enough money to travel.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls73 ws0"> While standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered his flock, and decided he should go back</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls150 ws0">to being a shepherd. In two years he had learned everything about shepherding: he knew how to shear</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls151 ws0">sheep, how to care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the sheep from wolves. He knew all the fields</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls152 ws0">and pastures of Andalusia. And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls153 ws0"> He decided to return to his friend&apos;s stable by the longest route possible. As he walked past the city&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls154 ws0">castle, he interrupted his return, and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall. From there, he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls155 ws0">could see Africa in the distance. Someone had once told him that it was from there that the Moors had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls156 ws0">come, to occupy all of Spain.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls157 ws0"> He could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including the plaza where he had talked with the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls158 ws0">old man. Curse the moment I met that old man, he thought. He had come to the town only to find a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls159 ws0">woman who could interpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the old man were at all impressed by the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15a ws0">fact that he was a shepherd. They were solitary individuals who no longer believed in things, and didn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3b ws0">understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep. He knew everything about each member of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15b ws0">his flock: he knew which ones were lame, which one was to give birth two months from now, and which</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15c ws0">were the laziest. He knew how to shear them, and how to slaughter them. If he ever decided to leave</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15d ws0">them, they would suffer.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Here I am, between my flock and my treasure, the boy thought. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls54 ws0">had to choose between something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted to have.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15f ws0">There was also the merchant&apos;s daughter, but she wasn&apos;t as important as his flock, because she didn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls160 ws0">depend on him. Maybe she didn&apos;t even remember him. He was sure that it made no difference to her on</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls161 ws0">which day he appeared: for her, every day was the same, and when each day is the same as the next, it&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls162 ws0">because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls163 ws0"> I left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They have gotten used to my being away, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls164 ws0">so have I. The sheep will get used to my not being there, too, the boy thought.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls165 ws0"> From where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued to come and go from the baker&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls166 ws0">shop. A young couple sat on the bench where he had talked with the old man, and they kissed.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls167 ws0"> &quot;That baker…&quot; he said to himself, without completing the thought. The levanter was still getting stronger,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsff ws0">and he felt its force on his face. That wind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also brought the smell</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls168 ws0">of the desert and of veiled women. It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls169 ws0">left to search for the unknown, and for gold and adventure—and for the Pyramids. The boy felt jealous</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls16a ws0">of the freedom of the wind, and saw that he could have the same freedom. There was nothing to hold him</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls16b ws0">back except himself. The sheep, the merchant&apos;s daughter, and the fields of Andalusia were only steps</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls16c ws0">along the way to his destiny.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls16d ws0"> The next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six sheep with him.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls16e ws0"> &quot;I&apos;m surprised,&quot; the boy said. &quot;My friend bought all the other sheep immediately. He said that he had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls16f ws0">always dreamed of being a shepherd, and that it was a good omen.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls170 ws0"> &quot;That&apos;s the way it always is,&quot; said the old man. &quot;It&apos;s called the principle of favorability. When you play</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls171 ws0">cards the first time, you are almost sure to win.

The boy explained that it</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls175 ws0">wasn&apos;t important, since that sheep was the most intelligent of the flock, and produced the most wool.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls176 ws0"> &quot;Where is the treasure?&quot; he asked.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls177 ws0"> &quot;It&apos;s in Egypt, near the Pyramids.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls178 ws0"> The boy was startled.

The lad wandered through the desert for forty days, and finally came upon a beautiful castle, high</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18a ws0">atop a mountain. It was there that the wise man lived.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18b ws0"> &quot;Rather than finding a saintly man, though, our hero, on entering the main room of the castle, saw a hive</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa1 ws0">of activity: tradesmen came and went, people were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18c ws0">playing soft music, and there was a table covered with platters of the most delicious food in that part of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18d ws0">the world. The wise man conversed with everyone, and the boy had to wait for two hours before it was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18e ws0">his turn to be given the man&apos;s attention.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18f ws0"> &quot;The wise man listened attentively to the boy&apos;s explanation of why he had come, but told him that he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls190 ws0">didn&apos;t have time just then to explain the secret of happiness. He suggested that the boy look around the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls191 ws0">palace and return in two hours.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls127 ws0"> &quot; &apos;Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,&apos; said the wise man, handing the boy a teaspoon that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls192 ws0">held two drops of oil. &apos;As you wander around, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil to spill.&apos;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls21 ws0"> &quot;The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of the palace, keeping his eyes fixed on the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls193 ws0">spoon.

He saw the gardens, the mountains all around him, the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19a ws0">beauty of the flowers, and the taste with which everything had been selected. Upon returning to the wise</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19b ws0">man, he related in detail everything he had seen.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19c ws0"> &quot; &apos;But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you?&apos; asked the wise man.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19d ws0"> &quot;Looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was gone.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19e ws0"> &quot; &apos;Well, there is only one piece of advice I can give you,&apos; said the wisest of wise men. &apos;The secret of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19f ws0">happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.&apos; &quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a0 ws0"> The shepherd said nothing.

Then, taking his sheep, he walked away.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a1 ws0"> At the highest point in Tarifa there is an old fort, built by the Moors. From atop its walls, one can catch a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a2 ws0">glimpse of Africa. Melchizedek, the king of Salem, sat on the wall of the fort that afternoon, and felt the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a3 ws0">levanter blowing in his face. The sheep fidgeted nearby, uneasy with their new owner and excited by so</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls158 ws0">much change. All they wanted was food and water.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a4 ws0"> Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port. He would never again see</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls47 ws0">the boy, just as he had never seen Abraham again after having charged him his one-tenth fee. That was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a5 ws0">his work.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls12d ws0"> The gods should not have desires, because they don&apos;t have destinies.

As a child in church, he had always looked at the image of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls103 ws0">Saint Santiago Matamoros on his white horse, his sword unsheathed, and figures such as these kneeling</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ae ws0">at his feet. The boy felt ill and terribly alone. The infidels had an evil look about them.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1af ws0"> Besides this, in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail, just one detail, which could keep him</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b0 ws0">from his treasure for a long time: only Arabic was spoken in this country.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b1 ws0"> The owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a drink that had been served at the next</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b2 ws0">table. It turned out to be a bitter tea. The boy preferred wine.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b3 ws0"> But he didn&apos;t need to worry about that right now. What he had to be concerned about was his treasure,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b4 ws0">and how he was going to go about getting it. The sale of his sheep had left him with enough money in his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse0 ws0">pouch, and the boy knew that in money there was magic; whoever has money is never really alone.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14c ws0">Before long, maybe in just a few days, he would be at the Pyramids. An old man, with a breastplate of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b5 ws0">gold, wouldn&apos;t have lied just to acquire six sheep.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b6 ws0"> The old man had spoken about signs and omens, and, as the boy was crossing the strait, he had thought</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b7 ws0">about omens. Yes, the old man had known what he was talking about: during the time the boy had spent</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b8 ws0">in the fields of Andalusia, he had become used to learning which path he should take by observing the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse9 ws0">ground and the sky. He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a snake was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b9 ws0">nearby, and that a certain shrub was a sign that there was water in the area. The sheep had taught him</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls126 ws0">that.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b7 ws0"> If God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he thought, and that made him feel better. The</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ba ws0">tea seemed less bitter.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls64 ws0"> &quot;Who are you?&quot; he heard a voice ask him in Spanish.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls193 ws0"> The boy was relieved. He was thinking about omens, and someone had appeared.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1bb ws0"> &quot;How come you speak Spanish?&quot; he asked. The new arrival was a young man in Western dress, but the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1bc ws0">color of his skin suggested he was from this city. He was about the same age and height as the boy.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1bd ws0"> &quot;Almost everyone here speaks Spanish. We&apos;re only two hours from Spain.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1be ws0"> &quot;Sit down, and let me treat you to something,&quot; said the boy. &quot;And ask for a glass of wine for me. I hate</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1bf ws0">this tea.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c0 ws0"> &quot;There is no wine in this country,&quot; the young man said. &quot;The religion here forbids it.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls12d ws0"> The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He almost began to tell about his treasure,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c1 ws0">but decided not to do so. If he did, it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as payment for</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c2 ws0">taking him there. He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn&apos;t even</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c3 ws0">have yet.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c4 ws0"> &quot;I&apos;d like you to take me there if you can.

He felt</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y21 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls79 ws0">uneasy at the man&apos;s presence. But he had found a guide, and didn&apos;t want to miss out on an opportunity.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c6 ws0"> &quot;You have to cross the entire Sahara desert,&quot; said the young man. &quot;And to do that, you need money. I</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c7 ws0">need to know whether you have enough.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c8 ws0"> The boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old man, who had said that, when you really</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c9 ws0">want something, the universe always conspires in your favor.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls156 ws0"> He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man. The owner of the bar came over</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ca ws0">and looked, as well. The two men exchanged some words in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed irritated.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5f ws0"> &quot;Let&apos;s get out of here&quot; said the new arrival. &quot;He wants us to leave.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1cb ws0"> The boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner grabbed him and began to speak to him</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1cc ws0">in an angry stream of words. The boy was strong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a foreign</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1cd ws0">country. His new friend pushed the owner aside, and pulled the boy outside with him. &quot;He wanted your</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls108 ws0">money,&quot; he said. &quot;Tangier is not like the rest of Africa. This is a port, and every port has its thieves.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ce ws0"> The boy trusted his new friend. He had helped him out in a dangerous situation. He took out his money</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls112 ws0">and counted it.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f ws0"> &quot;We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow,&quot; said the other, taking the money. &quot;But I have to buy two</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1cf ws0">camels.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse0 ws0"> They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier. Everywhere there were stalls with items for</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls54 ws0">sale. They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held. There were thousands of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5f ws0">people there, arguing, selling, and buying; vegetables for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb2 ws0">alongside tobacco. But the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all, he had all his money. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d0 ws0">thought about asking him to give it back, but decided that would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls94 ws0">the customs of the strange land he was in.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18b ws0"> &quot;I&apos;ll just watch him,&quot; he said to himself. He knew he was stronger than his friend.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb2 ws0"> Suddenly, there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the most beautiful sword he had ever seen. The</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d1 ws0">scabbard was embossed in silver, and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones. The boy</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls41 ws0">promised himself that, when he returned from Egypt, he would buy that sword.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d2 ws0"> &quot;Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs,&quot; he said to his friend. Then he realized that he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lscf ws0">had been distracted for a few moments, looking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d3 ws0">suddenly compressed it. He was afraid to look around, because he knew what he would find. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d4 ws0">continued to look at the beautiful sword for a bit longer, until he summoned the courage to turn around.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d5 ws0"> All around him was the market, with people coming and going, shouting and buying, and the aroma of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d6 ws0">strange foods… but nowhere could he find his new companion.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d7 ws0"> The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d8 ws0">decided to stay right there and await his return. As he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls13d ws0">tower and began his chant; everyone in the market fell to their knees, touched their foreheads to the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d9 ws0">ground, and took up the chant. Then, like a colony of worker ants, they dismantled their stalls and left.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

He recalled that when the sun had risen that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1db ws0">morning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd with sixty sheep, and looking forward to meeting</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1dc ws0">with a girl. That morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him as he walked through</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19 ws0">the familiar fields. But now, as the sun began to set, he was in a different country, a stranger in a strange</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1dd ws0">land, where he couldn&apos;t even speak the language. He was no longer a shepherd, and he had nothing, not</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1de ws0">even the money to return and start everything over.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b8 ws0"> All this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought. He was feeling sorry for himself, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1df ws0">lamenting the fact that his life could have changed so suddenly and so drastically.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e0 ws0"> He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even wept in front of his own sheep. But the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e1 ws0">marketplace was empty, and he was far from home, so he wept. He wept because God was unfair, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e2 ws0">because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e3 ws0"> When I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me happy. People saw me coming and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e4 ws0">welcomed me, he thought. But now I&apos;m sad and alone. I&apos;m going to become bitter and distrustful of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e5 ws0">people because one person betrayed me. I&apos;m going to hate those who have found their treasure because</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf8 ws0">I never found mine. And I&apos;m going to hold on to what little I have, because I&apos;m too insignificant to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e6 ws0">conquer the world.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls44 ws0"> He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions; maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e7 ws0">he had eaten on the ship. But all he found was the heavy book, his jacket, and the two stones the old</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e8 ws0">man had given him.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e9 ws0"> As he looked at the stones, he felt relieved for some reason. He had exchanged six sheep for two</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ea ws0">precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate. He could sell the stones and buy a return</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa0 ws0">ticket. But this time I&apos;ll be smarter, the boy thought, removing them from the pouch so he could put them</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1eb ws0">in his pocket. This was a port town, and the only truthful thing his friend had told him was that port towns</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ec ws0">are full of thieves.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ed ws0"> Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset: he was trying to tell him not to trust</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls198 ws0">that man. &quot;I&apos;m like everyone else—I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ee ws0">actually does.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ef ws0"> He ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces. They were</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f0 ws0">his treasure. Just handling them made him feel better. They reminded him of the old man.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f1 ws0"> &quot;When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it,&quot; he had said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f2 ws0"> The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said. There he was in the empty</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa3 ws0">marketplace, without a cent to his name, and with not a sheep to guard through the night. But the stones</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15c ws0">were proof that he had met with a king—a king who knew of the boy&apos;s past.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f3 ws0"> &quot;They&apos;re called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to read the omens.&quot; The boy put the stones</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f4 ws0">back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment. The old man had said to ask very clear questions,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls124 ws0">and to do that, the boy had to know what he wanted. So, he asked if the old man&apos;s blessing was still with</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f5 ws0">him.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsca ws0"> He took out one of the stones. It was &quot;yes.&quot;</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
<div id="pf12" class="pf w0 h0" data-page-no="12"><div class="pc pc12 w0 h0"><img class="bi x0 y0 w1 h1" alt="" src="bg12.png"/><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls135 ws0"> &quot;Am I going to find my treasure?&quot; he asked.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc0 ws0"> He stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the stones. As he did so, both of them</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f6 ws0">pushed through a hole in the pouch and fell to the ground. The boy had never even noticed that there was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsfe ws0">a hole in his pouch. He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch. But as he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls171 ws0">saw them lying there on the ground, another phrase came to his mind.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls11a ws0"> &quot;Learn to recognize omens, and follow them,&quot; the old king had said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc5 ws0"> An omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f7 ws0">didn&apos;t consider mending the hole—the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He had learned</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f8 ws0">that there were certain things one shouldn&apos;t ask about, so as not to flee from one&apos;s own destiny. &quot;I</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f9 ws0">promised that I would make my own decisions,&quot; he said to himself.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1fa ws0"> But the stones had told him that the old man was still with him, and that made him feel more confident.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1fb ws0">He looked around at the empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn&apos;t a strange</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1fc ws0">place; it was a new one.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1fd ws0"> After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places. Even if he never got to the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls11e ws0">Pyramids, he had already traveled farther than any shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1fe ws0">different things are just two hours by ship from where they are, he thought. Although his new world at the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1da ws0">moment was just an empty marketplace, he had already seen it when it was teeming with life, and he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ff ws0">would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It hurt him a bit to think about it, but he had never seen</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls200 ws0">one like it before. As he mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose between thinking of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls201 ws0">himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls202 ws0"> &quot;I&apos;m an adventurer, looking for treasure,&quot; he said to himself.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls203 ws0"> He was shaken into wakefulness by someone. He had fallen asleep in the middle of the marketplace, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls204 ws0">life in the plaza was about to resume.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls205 ws0"> Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in a new world. But instead of being</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls206 ws0">saddened, he was happy. He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep; he could go in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls207 ws0">search of his treasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket, but he had faith. He had decided, the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18d ws0">night before, that he would be as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18a ws0"> He walked slowly through the market. The merchants were assembling their stalls, and the boy helped a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf6 ws0">candy seller to do his. The candy seller had a smile on his face: he was happy, aware of what his life was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls208 ws0">about, and ready to begin a day&apos;s work. His smile reminded the boy of the old man—the mysterious old</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls209 ws0">king he had met. &quot;This candy merchant isn&apos;t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls20a ws0">shopkeeper&apos;s daughter. He&apos;s doing it because it&apos;s what he wants to do,&quot; thought the boy. He realized that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls114 ws0">he could do the same thing the old man had done—sense whether a person was near to or far from his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1bb ws0">destiny. Just by looking at them. It&apos;s easy, and yet I&apos;ve never done it before, he thought.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls20b ws0"> When the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy the first sweet he had made for the day.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls20c ws0">The boy thanked him, ate it, and went on his way. When he had gone only a short distance, he realized</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa4 ws0">that, while they were erecting the stall, one of them had spoken Arabic and the other Spanish.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls20d ws0"> And they had understood each other perfectly well.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
<div id="pf13" class="pf w0 h0" data-page-no="13"><div class="pc pc13 w0 h0"><img class="bi x0 y0 w1 h1" alt="" src="bg13.png"/><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y21 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls20e ws0"> There must be a language that doesn&apos;t depend on words, the boy thought. I&apos;ve already had that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls20f ws0">experience with my sheep, and now it&apos;s happening with people.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa7 ws0"> He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things that he had already experienced, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls161 ws0">weren&apos;t really new, but that he had never perceived before. And he hadn&apos;t perceived them because he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls43 ws0">had become accustomed to them. He realized: If I can learn to understand this language without words, I</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls210 ws0">can learn to understand the world.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls52 ws0"> Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of Tangier. Only in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd8 ws0">that way would he be able to read the omens. He knew it would require a lot of patience, but shepherds</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls211 ws0">know all about patience. Once again he saw that, in that strange land, he was applying the same lessons</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls108 ws0">he had learned with his sheep.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls212 ws0"> &quot;All things are one,&quot; the old man had said.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls213 ws0"> The crystal merchant awoke with the day, and felt the same anxiety that he felt every morning. He had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls214 ws0">been in the same place for thirty years: a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls98 ws0">Now it was too late to change anything—the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsbb ws0">crystal glassware. There had been a time when many people knew of his shop: Arab merchants, French</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls64 ws0">and English geologists, German soldiers who were always well-heeled. In those days it had been</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls215 ws0">wonderful to be selling crystal, and he had thought how he would become rich, and have beautiful women</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls216 ws0">at his side as he grew older.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd9 ws0"> But, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of Ceuta had grown faster than Tangier, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls217 ws0">business had fallen off. Neighbors moved away, and there remained only a few small shops on the hill.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls218 ws0">And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls219 ws0"> But the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years of his life buying and selling crystal</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls21a ws0">pieces, and now it was too late to do anything else.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls21b ws0"> He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street. He had done this</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls21c ws0">for years, and knew the schedule of everyone who passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy stopped in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls21d ws0">front of the shop. He was dressed normally, but the practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2b ws0">the boy had no money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delay his lunch for a few minutes</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls21e ws0">until the boy moved on.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls21f ws0"> A card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop. The boy saw</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls220 ws0">a man appear behind the counter.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse7 ws0"> &quot;I can clean up those glasses in the window, if you want,&quot; said the boy. &quot;The way they look now,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls177 ws0">nobody is going to want to buy them.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls221 ws0"> The man looked at him without responding.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls222 ws0"> &quot;In exchange, you could give me something to eat.&quot;</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

In his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y21 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls224 ws0">pouch, he had his jacket—he certainly wasn&apos;t going to need it in the desert. Taking the jacket out, he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls225 ws0">began to clean the glasses. In half an hour, he had cleaned all the glasses in the window, and, as he was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ca ws0">doing so, two customers had entered the shop and bought some crystal.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls226 ws0"> When he had completed the cleaning, he asked the man for something to eat. &quot;Let&apos;s go and have some</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls227 ws0">lunch,&quot; said the crystal merchant.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls228 ws0"> He put a sign on the door, and they went to a small café nearby. As they sat down at the only table in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls229 ws0">the place, the crystal merchant laughed.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls17d ws0"> &quot;You didn&apos;t have to do any cleaning,&quot; he said. &quot;The Koran requires me to feed a hungry person.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc9 ws0"> &quot;Well then, why did you let me do it?&quot; the boy asked.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22a ws0"> &quot;Because the crystal was dirty. And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf1 ws0"> When they had eaten, the merchant turned to the boy and said, &quot;I&apos;d like you to work in my shop. Two</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls13c ws0">customers came in today while you were working, and that&apos;s a good omen.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22b ws0"> People talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they really don&apos;t know what they&apos;re saying. Just</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls106 ws0">as I hadn&apos;t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8a ws0"> &quot;Do you want to go to work for me?&quot; the merchant asked.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls117 ws0"> &quot;I can work for the rest of today,&quot; the boy answered. &quot;I&apos;ll work all night, until dawn, and I&apos;ll clean every</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22c ws0">piece of crystal in your shop. In return, I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22d ws0"> The merchant laughed. &quot;Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year… even if you earned a good</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22e ws0">commission selling every piece, you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt. There are</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse6 ws0">thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22f ws0"> There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep. No sound from the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls10b ws0">bazaars, no arguments among the merchants, no men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls42 ws0">adventure, no old kings or destinies, no treasure, and no Pyramids. It was as if the world had fallen silent</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls230 ws0">because the boy&apos;s soul had. He sat there, staring blankly through the door of the café, wishing that he had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls231 ws0">died, and that everything would end forever at that moment.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls232 ws0"> The merchant looked anxiously at the boy.

That morning he had done some calculating: if he continued to work every day as he had been, he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y5b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls239 ws0">would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y5c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22b ws0"> &quot;I&apos;d like to build a display case for the crystal,&quot; the boy said to the merchant. &quot;We could place it outside,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y5d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls23a ws0">and attract those people who pass at the bottom of the hill.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y5e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a6 ws0"> &quot;I&apos;ve never had one before,&quot; the merchant answered. &quot;People will pass by and bump into it, and pieces</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y5f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls23b ws0">will be broken.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y60 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls23c ws0"> &quot;Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have died if we had come upon a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y61 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsbf ws0">snake.

Why ask more out of life?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y66 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls23f ws0"> &quot;Because we have to respond to omens,&quot; the boy said, almost without meaning to; then he regretted</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y67 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls190 ws0">what he had said, because the merchant had never met the king.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y68 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls240 ws0"> &quot;It&apos;s called the principle of favorability, beginner&apos;s luck.

The boy was being paid more money than he deserved, because the merchant, thinking that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y6d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls34 ws0">sales wouldn&apos;t amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate.

It&apos;s called the principle of favorability. Or beginner&apos;s luck.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls24f ws0"> The merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, &quot;The Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls250 ws0">just five obligations to satisfy during our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one true God.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls251 ws0">The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls252 ws0"> He stopped there.

We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy city</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls256 ws0">of Mecca.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15e ws0"> &quot;Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was young, all I wanted to do was put together</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls257 ws0">enough money to start this shop. I thought that someday I&apos;d be rich, and could go to Mecca. I began to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d4 ws0">make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop; the crystals</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls258 ws0">are delicate things. At the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading for Mecca.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ef ws0">Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels, but most of the people</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls236 ws0">making the pilgrimage were poorer than I.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls259 ws0"> &quot;All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f2 ws0">doors of their houses. One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls25a ws0">traveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls25b ws0">streets of Tangier buying his leather.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls25c ws0"> &quot;Well, why don&apos;t you go to Mecca now?&quot; asked the boy.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls25d ws0"> &quot;Because it&apos;s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive.

The boy</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls6d ws0">estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls154 ws0">another sixty. In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock, and he would be able to do business</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls262 ws0">with the Arabs, because he was now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls263 ws0">marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim, because Egypt was now just as</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls188 ws0">distant a dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become happy in his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf ws0">work, and thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a winner.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls264 ws0"> &quot;You must always know what it is that you want,&quot; the old king had said. The boy knew, and was now</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls265 ws0">working toward it. Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a thief,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls201 ws0">and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls266 ws0"> He was proud of himself.

One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of the hill,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls268 ws0">complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a climb. The</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4f ws0">boy, accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls269 ws0"> &quot;Let&apos;s sell tea to the people who climb the hill.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls26a ws0"> &quot;Lots of places sell tea around here,&quot; the merchant said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls137 ws0"> &quot;But we could sell tea in crystal glasses.

It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls84 ws0">as part of a search for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange city, and he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a1 ws0">felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a2 ws0"> &quot;When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it,&quot; the old king had said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ac ws0"> But the old king hadn&apos;t said anything about being robbed, or about endless deserts, or about people who</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a3 ws0">know what their dreams are but don&apos;t want to realize them. The old king hadn&apos;t told him that the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls164 ws0">Pyramids were just a pile of stones, or that anyone could build one in his backyard. And he had forgotten</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c8 ws0">to mention that, when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before, you</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a4 ws0">should buy it.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls234 ws0"> The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He went down the stairs and found the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a5 ws0">merchant waiting on a foreign couple, while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking tea</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a6 ws0">from crystal glasses. It was more activity than usual for this time of the morning. From where he stood, he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a7 ws0">saw for the first time that the old merchant&apos;s hair was very much like the hair of the old king. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a8 ws0">remembered the smile of the candy seller, on his first day in Tangier, when he had nothing to eat and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsfc ws0">nowhere to go—that smile had also been like the old king&apos;s smile.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27c ws0"> It&apos;s almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought. And yet, none of these people has ever</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a9 ws0">met the old king. On the other hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are trying to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2aa ws0">realize their destiny.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls23f ws0"> He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn&apos;t want to cry with the other people</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls80 ws0">there. He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned. He was more confident in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2ab ws0">himself, though, and felt as though he could conquer the world.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2ac ws0"> &quot;But I&apos;m going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my flock again.&quot; He said that to himself with</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls245 ws0">certainty, but he was no longer happy with his decision. He had worked for an entire year to make a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2ad ws0">dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was becoming less important. Maybe because that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1dc ws0">wasn&apos;t really his dream.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f ws0"> Who knows… maybe it&apos;s better to be like the crystal merchant: never go to Mecca, and just go through</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2ae ws0">life wanting to do so, he thought, again trying to convince himself. But as he held Urim and Thummim in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2af ws0">his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and will of the old king. By coincidence—or maybe it</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls17b ws0">was an omen, the boy thought—he came to the bar he had entered on his first day there. The thief wasn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls25d ws0">there, and the owner brought him a cup of tea.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2b0 ws0"> I can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I learned how to care for sheep, and I</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls98 ws0">haven&apos;t forgotten how that&apos;s done. But maybe I&apos;ll never have another chance to get to the Pyramids in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a1 ws0">Egypt.

First he had studied Esperanto, then the world&apos;s religions, and now it</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls32 ws0">was alchemy. He knew how to speak Esperanto, he understood all the major religions well, but he wasn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls39 ws0">yet an alchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind important questions, but his studies had taken him to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb9 ws0">a point beyond which he could not seem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c1 ws0">alchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only about themselves, and almost</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls154 ws0">always refused to help him. Who knows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1cb ws0">Work—the Philosopher&apos;s Stone—and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsba ws0"> He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father, fruitlessly seeking the Philosopher&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c2 ws0">Stone. He had spent enormous amounts of time at the great libraries of the world, and had purchased all</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls173 ws0">the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy. In one he had read that, many years ago, a famous</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls106 ws0">Arabian alchemist had visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two hundred years old, and that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c3 ws0">he had discovered the Philosopher&apos;s Stone and the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb9 ws0">impressed by the story. But he would never have thought it more than just a myth, had not a friend of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c4 ws0">his—returning from an archaeological expedition in the desert—told him about an Arab that was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c5 ws0">possessed of exceptional powers.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c6 ws0"> &quot;He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,&quot; his friend had said. &quot;And people say that he is two hundred years old,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ae ws0">and is able to transform any metal into gold.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c7 ws0"> The Englishman could not contain his excitement.

But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver&apos;s comment: maybe he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls30d ws0">was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the present of all people. &quot;Hunches,&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a5 ws0">his mother used to call them. The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls183 ws0">immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls57 ws0">we are able to know everything, because it&apos;s all written there.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27e ws0"> &quot;<span class="_ _0"></span><span class="ff3 ls27f">Maktub<span class="_ _0"></span></span><span class="ls204">,&quot; the boy said, remembering the crystal merchant.</span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls30e ws0"> The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others. When the caravan was blocked by a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls30f ws0">boulder, it had to go around it; if there was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour. If the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls310 ws0">sand was too fine for the animals&apos; hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more substantial. In</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls23e ws0">some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes. The animals balked at such places,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2fa ws0">and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden their charges. The drivers carried the freight</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls311 ws0">themselves over such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a guide were to fall ill or die,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls312 ws0">the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2cc ws0"> But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many detours and adjustments it made, the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls313 ws0">caravan moved toward the same compass point. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls149 ws0">course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis. When the people saw that star shining in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lscc ws0">the morning sky, they knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees, shelter, and other</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls314 ws0">people. It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all this; he was, for the most part, immersed in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2b5 ws0">reading his books.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls315 ws0"> The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first few days of the journey. But he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls316 ws0">found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had learned</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2eb ws0">to know his camel better, and to establish a relationship with him, he threw the book away. Although the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls317 ws0">boy had developed a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn something</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls210 ws0">important, he decided it was an unnecessary burden.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls215 ws0"> He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him. At night, as they sat around the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3b ws0">fire, the boy related to the driver his adventures as a shepherd.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c2 ws0"> During one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls89 ws0"> &quot;I used to live near El Cairum,&quot; he said. &quot;I had my orchard, my children, and a life that would change not</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls318 ws0">at all until I died. One year, when the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I satisfied the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls319 ws0">only unmet obligation in my life.

They spent so much time close to the fire that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls34a ws0">gradually they gave up the vanities of the world.

He read the lives of the various people who had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls34d ws0">succeeded in doing so: Helvétius, Elias, Fulcanelli, and Geber. They were fascinating stories: each of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls34e ws0">them lived out his destiny to the end.

The dunes were</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls245 ws0">changed constantly by the wind, yet these were the same sands he had known since he was a child. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22c ws0">always enjoyed seeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after weeks of yellow sand and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls372 ws0">blue sky, they first saw the green of the date palms. Maybe God created the desert so that man could</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls373 ws0">appreciate the date trees, he thought.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls374 ws0"> He decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew that in the caravan there was a man to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls76 ws0">whom he was to teach some of his secrets. The omens had told him so. He didn&apos;t know the man yet, but</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls114 ws0">his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared. He hoped that it would be someone as</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls375 ws0">capable as his previous apprentice.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls211 ws0"> I don&apos;t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth, he thought. It wasn&apos;t exactly</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lscf ws0">that they were secrets; God revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls31c ws0"> He had only one explanation for this fact: things have to be transmitted this way because they were made</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls376 ws0">up from the pure life, and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls310 ws0"> Because people become fascinated with pictures and words, and wind up forgetting the Language of the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls95 ws0">World.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

The</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf4 ws0">men of the oasis wanted to know if they had seen any fighting, and the women competed with one</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls37d ws0">another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants. The silence of the desert</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls37e ws0">was a distant dream; the travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly, laughing and shouting, as if they</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1af ws0">had emerged from the spiritual world and found themselves once again in the world of people. They were</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc ws0">relieved and happy.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd7 ws0"> They had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the camel driver explained to the boy that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls61 ws0">oases were always considered to be neutral territories, because the majority of the inhabitants were</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls173 ws0">women and children. There were oases throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought in the desert,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls35 ws0">leaving the oases as places of refuge.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls37f ws0"> With some difficulty, the leader of the caravan brought all his people together and gave them his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls17c ws0">instructions. The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was over.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls380 ws0">Since they were visitors, they would have to share living space with those who lived there, and would be</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls381 ws0">given the best accommodations. That was the law of hospitality. Then he asked that everyone, including</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls382 ws0">his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the men appointed by the tribal chieftains.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22c ws0"> &quot;Those are the rules of war,&quot; the leader explained. &quot;The oases may not shelter armies or troops.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ff ws0"> To the boy&apos;s surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated revolver out of his bag and gave it to the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse ws0">men who were collecting the arms.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d7 ws0"> &quot;Why a revolver?&quot; he asked.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls37f ws0"> &quot;It helped me to trust in people,&quot; the Englishman answered.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls281 ws0"> Meanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure. The closer he got to the realization of his dream, the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls170 ws0">more difficult things became. It seemed as if what the old king had called &quot;beginner&apos;s luck&quot; were no longer</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls383 ws0">functioning. In his pursuit of the dream, he was being constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls163 ws0">courage. So he could not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c3 ws0">the signs and omens left by God along his path.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls384 ws0"> God placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with the thought. Until then, he had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1da ws0">considered the omens to be things of this world. Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls98 ws0">job. He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls385 ws0"> &quot;Don&apos;t be impatient,&quot; he repeated to himself. &quot;It&apos;s like the camel driver said: &apos;Eat when it&apos;s time to eat.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2e9 ws0">And move along when it&apos;s time to move along.&apos; &quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls386 ws0"> That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the Englishman.

They were people of the desert,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y21 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15e ws0">and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls387 ws0"> The boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to tell them of his experiences at the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls388 ws0">crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4d ws0"> &quot;I&apos;ve been looking for you all morning,&quot; he said, as he led the boy outside. &quot;I need you to help me find</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14f ws0">out where the alchemist lives.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse ws0"> First, they tried to find him on their own. An alchemist would probably live in a manner that was different</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls389 ws0">from that of the rest of the people at the oasis, and it was likely that in his tent an oven was continuously</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls38a ws0">burning. They searched everywhere, and found that the oasis was much larger than they could have</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls38b ws0">imagined; there were hundreds of tents.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls204 ws0"> &quot;We&apos;ve wasted almost the entire day,&quot; said the Englishman, sitting down with the boy near one of the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls38c ws0">wells.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls38d ws0"> &quot;Maybe we&apos;d better ask someone,&quot; the boy suggested.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls33f ws0"> The Englishman didn&apos;t want to tell others about his reasons for being at the oasis, and couldn&apos;t make up</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls38e ws0">his mind. But, finally, he agreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so. The boy</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls38f ws0">approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls381 ws0"> &quot;Good afternoon, ma&apos;am. I&apos;m trying to find out where the alchemist lives here at the oasis.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls82 ws0"> The woman said she had never heard of such a person, and hurried away. But before she fled, she</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e1 ws0">advised the boy that he had better not try to converse with women who were dressed in black, because</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsfd ws0">they were married women. He should respect tradition.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls390 ws0"> The Englishman was disappointed. It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing. The boy was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls259 ws0">also saddened; his friend was in pursuit of his destiny. And, when someone was in such pursuit, the entire</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf7 ws0">universe made an effort to help him succeed—that&apos;s what the old king had said. He couldn&apos;t have been</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls391 ws0">wrong.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8b ws0"> &quot;I had never heard of alchemists before,&quot; the boy said. &quot;Maybe no one here has, either.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls352 ws0"> The Englishman&apos;s eyes lit up. &quot;That&apos;s it! Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is!

Then a man approached.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4a ws0"> &quot;Do you know someone here who cures people&apos;s illnesses?&quot; the boy asked.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls393 ws0"> &quot;Allah cures our illnesses,&quot; said the man, clearly frightened of the strangers. &quot;You&apos;re looking for witch</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls394 ws0">doctors.&quot; He spoke some verses from the Koran, and moved on.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls395 ws0"> Another man appeared. He was older, and was carrying a small bucket. The boy repeated his question.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls396 ws0"> &quot;Why do you want to find that sort of person?&quot; the Arab asked.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Only when he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls385 ws0">consents.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls13a ws0"> &quot;Wait for the end of the war. Then leave with the caravan.

They were on the right track.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls398 ws0"> Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She had a vessel on her shoulder,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls399 ws0">and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls28a ws0">the alchemist.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19b ws0"> At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls39a ws0">When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18a ws0">learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke—the language that everyone on</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls194 ws0">earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than humanity, more</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5a ws0">ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa6 ws0">theirs here at the well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omen—the omen he had been awaiting,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls93 ws0">without even knowing he was, for all his life. The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18 ws0">books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls25d ws0"> It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls341 ws0">travels through endless time. What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls60 ws0">woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. He was more certain</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a7 ws0">of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ab ws0">love and really know a person before becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls263 ws0">never learned the universal language. Because, when you know that language, it&apos;s easy to understand that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls17a ws0">someone in the world awaits you, whether it&apos;s in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls39b ws0">two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls39c ws0">There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls243 ws0">one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls342 ws0">Without such love, one&apos;s dreams would have no meaning.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls39d ws0"> Maktub<span class="_ _0"></span><span class="ff2 ls39e">, thought the boy.</span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c ws0"> The Englishman shook the boy: &quot;Come on, ask her!&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8e ws0"> The boy stepped closer to the girl, and when she smiled, he did the same.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls39f ws0"> &quot;What&apos;s your name?&quot; he asked.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls167 ws0"> &quot;Fatima,&quot; the girl said, averting her eyes.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2df ws0"> &quot;That&apos;s what some women in my country are called.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsed ws0"> &quot;It&apos;s the name of the Prophet&apos;s daughter,&quot; Fatima said. &quot;The invaders carried the name everywhere.&quot; The</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3a0 ws0">beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

He wanted to tell him about Fatima. He was surprised when</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls170 ws0">he saw that the Englishman had built himself a furnace outside his tent. It was a strange furnace, fueled by</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls333 ws0">firewood, with a transparent flask heating on top. As the Englishman stared out at the desert, his eyes</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls37 ws0">seemed brighter than they had when he was reading his books.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls138 ws0"> &quot;This is the first phase of the job,&quot; he said. &quot;I have to separate out the sulfur. To do that successfully, I</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls39 ws0">must have no fear of failure. It was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master Work.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b9 ws0">Now, I&apos;m beginning what I could have started ten years ago. But I&apos;m happy at least that I didn&apos;t wait</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls23b ws0">twenty years.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf ws0"> He continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the desert turned pink in the setting sun. He felt</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2bf ws0">the urge to go out into the desert, to see if its silence held the answers to his questions.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls205 ws0"> He wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight. He listened to the wind, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsde ws0">felt the stones beneath his feet. Here and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in remote</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3b9 ws0">times, had been a sea. He sat on a stone, and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls360 ws0">tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn&apos;t separate them. But Fatima</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls169 ws0">was a woman of the desert, and, if anything could help him to understand, it was the desert.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls284 ws0"> As he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him. Looking up, he saw a pair of hawks flying high</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3ba ws0">in the sky.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3bb ws0"> He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind. Although their flight appeared to have no pattern, it</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15c ws0">made a certain kind of sense to the boy. It was just that he couldn&apos;t grasp what it meant. He followed the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2da ws0">movement of the birds, trying to read something into it. Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3bc ws0">meaning of love without ownership.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls36a ws0"> He felt sleepy. In his heart, he wanted to remain awake, but he also wanted to sleep. &quot;I am learning the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3bd ws0">Language of the World, and everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me… even the flight of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls94 ws0">the hawks,&quot; he said to himself. And, in that mood, he was grateful to be in love. When you are in love,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1db ws0">things make even more sense, he thought.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf0 ws0"> Suddenly, one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky, attacking the other. As it did so, a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c7 ws0">sudden, fleeting image came to the boy: an army, with its swords at the ready, riding into the oasis. The</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls383 ws0">vision vanished immediately, but it had shaken him. He had heard people speak of mirages, and had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3be ws0">already seen some himself: they were desires that, because of their intensity, materialized over the sands</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3bf ws0">of the desert. But he certainly didn&apos;t desire that an army invade the oasis.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls323 ws0"> He wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation. He tried again to concentrate on the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls145 ws0">pink shades of the desert, and its stones. But there was something there in his heart that wouldn&apos;t allow</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls316 ws0">him to do so.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2de ws0"> &quot;Always heed the omens,&quot; the old king had said. The boy recalled what he had seen in the vision, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb2 ws0">sensed that it was actually going to occur.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3c0 ws0"> He rose, and made his way back toward the palm trees. Once again, he perceived the many languages</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d9 ws0">in the things about him: this time, the desert was safe, and it was the oasis that had become dangerous.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3c1 ws0"> The camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree, observing the sunset.

He knew that any given thing on the face of the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3c5 ws0">earth could reveal the history of all things. One could open a book to any page, or look at a person&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls226 ws0">hand; one could turn a card, or watch the flight of the birds… whatever the thing observed, one could</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3c6 ws0">find a connection with his experience of the moment. Actually, it wasn&apos;t that those things, in themselves,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls348 ws0">revealed anything at all; it was just that people, looking at what was occurring around them, could find a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls123 ws0">means of penetration to the Soul of the World.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsee ws0"> The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls179 ws0">the Soul of the World.

So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the present was full</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls35c ws0">of surprises, and they had to be aware of many things: Where was the enemy&apos;s sword?

The camel driver was not a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls380 ws0">fighter, and he had consulted with seers. Many of them had been right about what they said, while some</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3c8 ws0">had been wrong. Then, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out (and the one most to be feared)</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls173 ws0">had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls375 ws0"> &quot;Well… so I can do things,&quot; he had responded. &quot;And so I can change those things that I don&apos;t want to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2d4 ws0">happen.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls191 ws0"> &quot;But then they wouldn&apos;t be a part of your future,&quot; the seer had said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd2 ws0"> &quot;Well, maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare myself for what&apos;s coming.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls34b ws0"> &quot;If good things are coming, they will be a pleasant surprise,&quot; said the seer. &quot;If bad things are, and you</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3c9 ws0">know in advance, you will suffer greatly before they even occur.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18 ws0"> &quot;I want to know about the future because I&apos;m a man,&quot; the camel driver had said to the seer. &quot;And men</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3ca ws0">always live their lives based on the future.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8d ws0"> The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs; he threw them on the ground, and made interpretations</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e0 ws0">based on how they fell.

They believe that if they have to know about something</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2e ws0">Allah wants them to know, someone will tell them about it. It has happened many times before. But, this</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsfa ws0">time, the person is you.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d3 ws0"> The boy thought of Fatima. And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa8 ws0"> The boy approached the guard at the front of the huge white tent at the center of the oasis.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls32c ws0"> &quot;I want to see the chieftains. I&apos;ve brought omens from the desert.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls6f ws0"> Without responding, the guard entered the tent, where he remained for some time. When he emerged, it</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls36a ws0">was with a young Arab, dressed in white and gold. The boy told the younger man what he had seen, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d4 ws0">the man asked him to wait there. He disappeared into the tent.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls162 ws0"> Night fell, and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent. One by one, the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d2 ws0">campfires were extinguished, and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert. Only the lights in the great tent</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d5 ws0">remained. During all this time, the boy thought about Fatima, and he was still unable to understand his last</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d6 ws0">conversation with her.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2bf ws0"> Finally, after hours of waiting, the guard bade the boy enter. The boy was astonished by what he saw</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls132 ws0">inside. Never could he have imagined that, there in the middle of the desert, there existed a tent like this</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d7 ws0">one. The ground was covered with the most beautiful carpets he had ever walked upon, and from the top</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d8 ws0">of the structure hung lamps of hand-wrought gold, each with a lighted candle. The tribal chieftains were</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d9 ws0">seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle, resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3da ws0">came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants maintained the fires in the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3db ws0">hookahs. The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

At his side was the young Arab</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1fd ws0">the boy had spoken with earlier.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls24f ws0"> &quot;Who is this stranger who speaks of omens?&quot; asked one of the chieftains, eyeing the boy.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3dd ws0"> &quot;It is I,&quot; the boy answered. And he told what he had seen.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls10b ws0"> &quot;Why would the desert reveal such things to a stranger, when it knows that we have been here for</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3de ws0">generations?&quot; said another of the chieftains.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls33c ws0"> &quot;Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,&quot; the boy said. &quot;I can see things that eyes</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3df ws0">habituated to the desert might not see.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls109 ws0"> And also because I know about the Soul of the World, he thought to himself.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d9 ws0"> &quot;The oasis is neutral ground. No one attacks an oasis,&quot; said a third chieftain.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls152 ws0"> &quot;I can only tell you what I saw. If you don&apos;t want to believe me, you don&apos;t have to do anything about it.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb8 ws0"> The men fell into an animated discussion. They spoke in an Arabic dialect that the boy didn&apos;t understand,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2f6 ws0">but, when he made to leave, the guard told him to stay. The boy became fearful; the omens told him that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls316 ws0">something was wrong. He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e0 ws0">desert.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls138 ws0"> Suddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, and the boy felt better. The man hadn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d4 ws0">participated in the discussion, and, in fact, hadn&apos;t said a word up to that point. But the boy was already</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e1 ws0">used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d0 ws0">his intuition was that he had been right in coming.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls39 ws0"> The discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls157 ws0">was saying. Then he turned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls238 ws0"> &quot;Two thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed in dreams was thrown into a dungeon</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls226 ws0">and then sold as a slave,&quot; the old man said, now in the dialect the boy understood. &quot;Our merchants</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e2 ws0">bought that man, and brought him to Egypt. All of us know that whoever believes in dreams also knows</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls221 ws0">how to interpret them.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls44 ws0"> The elder continued, &quot;When the pharaoh dreamed of cows that were thin and cows that were fat, this</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e3 ws0">man I&apos;m speaking of rescued Egypt from famine. His name was Joseph. He, too, was a stranger in a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls235 ws0">strange land, like you, and he was probably about your age.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls147 ws0"> He paused, and his eyes were still unfriendly.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls34b ws0"> &quot;We always observe the Tradition. The Tradition saved Egypt from famine in those days, and made the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls97 ws0">Egyptians the wealthiest of peoples. The Tradition teaches men how to cross the desert, and how their</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls7f ws0">children should marry. The Tradition says that an oasis is neutral territory, because both sides have oases,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa7 ws0">and so both are vulnerable.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e4 ws0"> No one said a word as the old man continued.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Everything we know was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3bf ws0">taught to us by the desert.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls37c ws0"> The old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was over. The hookahs were extinguished,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e5 ws0">and the guards stood at attention. The boy made ready to leave, but the old man spoke again:</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e6 ws0"> &quot;Tomorrow, we are going to break the agreement that says that no one at the oasis may carry arms.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e7 ws0">Throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies. When the sun sets, the men will</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls265 ws0">once again surrender their arms to me. For every ten dead men among our enemies, you will receive a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls16e ws0">piece of gold.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e8 ws0"> &quot;But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle. Arms are as capricious as the desert, and, if</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls34b ws0">they are not used, the next time they might not function. If at least one of them hasn&apos;t been used by the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e9 ws0">end of the day tomorrow, one will be used on you.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3ea ws0"> When the boy left the tent, the oasis was illuminated only by the light of the full moon. He was twenty</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a6 ws0">minutes from his tent, and began to make his way there.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls289 ws0"> He was alarmed by what had happened. He had succeeded in reaching through to the Soul of the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls108 ws0">World, and now the price for having done so might be his life. It was a frightening bet. But he had been</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2cc ws0">making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to pursue his destiny. And, as the camel driver</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3eb ws0">had said, to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day. Every day was there to be lived or</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e3 ws0">to mark one&apos;s departure from this world. Everything depended on one word: &quot;<span class="_ _0"></span><span class="ff3 ls27f">Maktub<span class="_ _0"></span></span><span class="ls27e">.&quot;</span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3ec ws0"> Walking along in the silence, he had no regrets. If he died tomorrow, it would be because God was not</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3ed ws0">willing to change the future. He would at least have died after having crossed the strait, after having</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3ee ws0">worked in a crystal shop, and after having known the silence of the desert and Fatima&apos;s eyes. He had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls118 ws0">lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago. If he died tomorrow, he would</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3ef ws0">already have seen more than other shepherds, and he was proud of that.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18 ws0"> Suddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to the ground by a wind such as he had never</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19b ws0">known. The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view. Before him was an</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls302 ws0">enormous white horse, rearing over him with a frightening scream.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsc8 ws0"> When the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what he saw. Astride the animal was a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22c ws0">horseman dressed completely in black, with a falcon perched on his left shoulder. He wore a turban and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f0 ws0">his entire face, except for his eyes, was covered with a black kerchief. He appeared to be a messenger</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls28c ws0">from the desert, but his presence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls350 ws0"> The strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle. The</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f1 ws0">steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd2 ws0"> &quot;Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?&quot; he demanded, so loudly that his words</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1af ws0">seemed to echo through the fifty thousand palm trees of Al-Fayoum.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf3 ws0"> &quot;It is I who dared to do so,&quot; said the boy. He was reminded of the image of Santiago Matamoros,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f2 ws0">mounted on his white horse, with the infidels beneath his hooves. This man looked exactly the same,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f3 ws0">except that now the roles were reversed.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd6 ws0"> &quot;It is I who dared to do so,&quot; he repeated, and he lowered his head to receive a blow from the sword.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

It didn&apos;t even occur to the boy to flee. In his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f6 ws0">heart, he felt a strange sense of joy: he was about to die in pursuit of his destiny. And for Fatima. The</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f7 ws0">omens had been true, after all. Here he was, face-to-face with his enemy, but there was no need to be</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f8 ws0">concerned about dying—the Soul of the World awaited him, and he would soon be a part of it. And,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls109 ws0">tomorrow, his enemy would also be apart of that Soul.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls31d ws0"> The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy&apos;s forehead. &quot;Why did you read the flight of the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f9 ws0">birds?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a3 ws0"> &quot;I read only what the birds wanted to tell me.

Allah taught me the language of the birds.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19 ws0">Everything has been written by the same hand,&quot; the boy said, remembering the camel driver&apos;s words.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse4 ws0"> The stranger withdrew the sword from the boy&apos;s forehead, and the boy felt immensely relieved. But he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3fb ws0">still couldn&apos;t flee.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf8 ws0"> &quot;Be careful with your prognostications,&quot; said the stranger. &quot;When something is written, there is no way to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3fc ws0">change it.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa1 ws0"> &quot;All I saw was an army,&quot; said the boy. &quot;I didn&apos;t see the outcome of the battle.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls20c ws0"> The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer.

Were it not for the bodies there on the ground, it</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls256 ws0">would have appeared to be a normal day at the oasis.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ff ws0"> The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion. That afternoon, he was brought before</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls9f ws0">the tribal chieftains, who asked him why he had violated the Tradition. The commander said that his men</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1cb ws0">had been starving and thirsty, exhausted from many days of battle, and had decided to take the oasis so</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls409 ws0">as to be able to return to the war.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls258 ws0"> The tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen, but that the Tradition was sacred. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls261 ws0">condemned the commander to death without honor. Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet, he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls23a ws0">was hanged from a dead palm tree, where his body twisted in the desert wind.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls20f ws0"> The tribal chieftain called for the boy, and presented him with fifty pieces of gold. He repeated his story</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls40a ws0">about Joseph of Egypt, and asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis.</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls40b ws0"> When the sun had set, and the first stars made their appearance, the boy started to walk to the south. He</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls112 ws0">eventually sighted a single tent, and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls21d ws0">by genies. But the boy sat down and waited.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e4 ws0"> Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view. He carried two dead hawks over his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls40c ws0">shoulder.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls266 ws0"> &quot;I am here,&quot; the boy said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls381 ws0"> &quot;You shouldn&apos;t be here,&quot; the alchemist answered. &quot;Or is it your destiny that brings you here?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3eb ws0"> &quot;With the wars between the tribes, it&apos;s impossible to cross the desert. So I have come here.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls92 ws0"> The alchemist dismounted from his horse, and signaled that the boy should enter the tent with him.

The boy understood. Another person was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls415 ws0">there to help him toward his destiny.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c0 ws0"> &quot;So you are going to instruct me?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1ce ws0"> &quot;No. You already know all you need to know.

I have a camel, I have my money from the crystal shop, and I have</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls41a ws0">fifty gold pieces. In my own country, I would be a rich man.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls41b ws0"> &quot;But none of that is from the Pyramids,&quot; said the alchemist.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls306 ws0"> &quot;I also have Fatima.

Remember that wherever your heart is, there you</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls29c ws0">will find your treasure.

Camels are traitorous: they walk thousands of paces and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa4 ws0">never seem to tire. Then suddenly, they kneel and die. But horses tire bit by bit. You always know how</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls10 ws0">much you can ask of them, and when it is that they are about to die.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x2 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27 ws0"> *</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls9d ws0"> The following night, the boy appeared at the alchemist&apos;s tent with a horse. The alchemist was ready, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls41f ws0">he mounted his own steed and placed the falcon on his left shoulder. He said to the boy, &quot;Show me</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls304 ws0">where there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2f6 ws0"> They began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting their way. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll be able to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls247 ws0">find life in the desert, the boy thought. I don&apos;t know the desert that well yet.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls420 ws0"> He wanted to say so to the alchemist, but he was afraid of the man. They reached the rocky place where</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls17e ws0">the boy had seen the hawks in the sky, but now there was only silence and the wind.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls13d ws0"> &quot;I don&apos;t know how to find life in the desert,&quot; the boy said. &quot;I know that there is life here, but I don&apos;t know</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls16b ws0">where to look.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls388 ws0"> &quot;Life attracts life,&quot; the alchemist answered.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls421 ws0"> And then the boy understood. He loosened the reins on his horse, who galloped forward over the rocks</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5f ws0">and sand. The alchemist followed as the boy&apos;s horse ran for almost half an hour. They could no longer</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf9 ws0">see the palms of the oasis—only the gigantic moon above them, and its silver reflections from the stones</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls422 ws0">of the desert. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the boy&apos;s horse began to slow.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d7 ws0"> &quot;There&apos;s life here,&quot; the boy said to the alchemist. &quot;I don&apos;t know the language of the desert, but my horse</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls423 ws0">knows the language of life.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls349 ws0"> They dismounted, and the alchemist said nothing. Advancing slowly, they searched among the stones.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8e ws0">The alchemist stopped abruptly, and bent to the ground. There was a hole there among the stones. The</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2c ws0">alchemist put his hand into the hole, and then his entire arm, up to his shoulder. Something was moving</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls281 ws0">there, and the alchemist&apos;s eyes—the boy could see only his eyes-squinted with his effort. His arm seemed</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e2 ws0">to be battling with whatever was in the hole. Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls424 ws0">arm and leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls425 ws0"> The boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist. The snake fought frantically, making hissing sounds</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls245 ws0">that shattered the silence of the desert. It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in minutes.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls426 ws0"> &quot;Watch out for his venom,&quot; the boy said. But even though the alchemist had put his hand in the hole, and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls427 ws0">had surely already been bitten, his expression was calm. &quot;The alchemist is two hundred years old,&quot; the</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

He must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls224 ws0"> The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar. With its blade, he drew a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3d2 ws0">circle in the sand, and then he placed the snake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lse7 ws0"> &quot;Not to worry,&quot; said the alchemist. &quot;He won&apos;t leave the circle. You found life in the desert, the omen that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y44 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls156 ws0">I needed.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5e ws0"> &quot;Why was that so important?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y50 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls16f ws0"> &quot;Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls85 ws0"> The boy didn&apos;t want to talk about the Pyramids. His heart was heavy, and he had been melancholy since</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3bb ws0">the previous night. To continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls390 ws0"> &quot;I&apos;m going to guide you across the desert,&quot; the alchemist said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls428 ws0"> &quot;I want to stay at the oasis,&quot; the boy answered. &quot;I&apos;ve found Fatima, and, as far as I&apos;m concerned, she&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14d ws0">worth more than treasure.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls203 ws0"> &quot;Fatima is a woman of the desert,&quot; said the alchemist. &quot;She knows that men have to go away in order to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls273 ws0">return. And she already has her treasure: it&apos;s you.

You&apos;ll marry Fatima, and you&apos;ll both be happy for a year. You&apos;ll learn to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls94 ws0">love the desert, and you&apos;ll get to know every one of the fifty thousand palms. You&apos;ll watch them as they</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls287 ws0">grow, demonstrating how the world is always changing. And you&apos;ll get better and better at understanding</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa ws0">omens, because the desert is the best teacher there is.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls42b ws0"> &quot;Sometime during the second year, you&apos;ll remember about the treasure. The omens will begin insistently</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d7 ws0">to speak of it, and you&apos;ll try to ignore them. You&apos;ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls42c ws0">inhabitants. The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do.

But you will love her, and she&apos;ll return your love. You&apos;ll remember that she never</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsca ws0">asked you to stay, because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man. So you won&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls42d ws0">blame her. But many times you&apos;ll walk the sands of the desert, thinking that maybe you could have left…</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls127 ws0">that you could have trusted more in your love for Fatima. Because what kept you at the oasis was your</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3b7 ws0">own fear that you might never come back.

The young Arab did as he was asked, and was given enough gold to buy yet</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls10d ws0">another sheep.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls435 ws0"> &quot;Now leave us alone,&quot; said the boy to the young Arab. The Arab returned to his tent to sleep, proud to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf4 ws0">have helped the counselor of the oasis, and happy at having enough money to buy himself some sheep.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls345 ws0"> Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent. The two walked out among the palms. The boy knew that it</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls436 ws0">was a violation of the Tradition, but that didn&apos;t matter to him now.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls437 ws0"> &quot;I&apos;m going away,&quot; he said. &quot;And I want you to know that I&apos;m coming back. I love you because…&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls438 ws0"> &quot;Don&apos;t say anything,&quot; Fatima interrupted. &quot;One is loved because one is loved.

Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls469 ws0"> &quot;My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,&quot; the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls46a ws0">the moonless sky.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls46b ws0"> &quot;Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls46c ws0">suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second&apos;s encounter</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls46d ws0">with God and with eternity.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls46e ws0"> &quot;Every second of the search is an encounter with God,&quot; the boy told his heart. &quot;When I have been truly</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a6 ws0">searching for my treasure, every day has been luminous, because I&apos;ve known that every hour was a part</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls40 ws0">of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I&apos;ve discovered things</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls22b ws0">along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls46f ws0">impossible for a shepherd to achieve.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls470 ws0"> So his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the boy slept deeply, and, when he awoke, his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls401 ws0">heart began to tell him things that came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people who are happy</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2a3 ws0">have God within them. And that happiness could be found in a grain of sand from the desert, as the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a2 ws0">alchemist had said. Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken millions</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls471 ws0">of years to create it. &quot;Everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him,&quot; his heart said. &quot;We, people&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls295 ws0">hearts, seldom say much about those treasures, because people no longer want to go in search of them.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18c ws0">We speak of them only to children. Later, we simply let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls194 ws0">fate. But, unfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to their destinies, and to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls472 ws0">happiness. Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls473 ws0">indeed, to be a threatening place.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls474 ws0"> &quot;So, we, their hearts, speak more and more softly.

It does this not because it is evil, but so that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls106 ws0">we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we&apos;ve learned as we&apos;ve moved toward that</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa3 ws0">dream. That&apos;s the point at which most people give up.

With every day that passed, the boy&apos;s heart became more and more</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls306 ws0">silent. It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future; it was content simply to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5d ws0">contemplate the desert, and to drink with the boy from the Soul of the World. The boy and his heart had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1a6 ws0">become friends, and neither was capable now of betraying the other.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls482 ws0"> When his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the boy, and to give him strength, because</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls44f ws0">the days of silence there in the desert were wearisome. His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3ba ws0">were: his courage in having given up his sheep and in trying to live out his destiny, and his enthusiasm</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls101 ws0">during the time he had worked at the crystal shop.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls14b ws0"> And his heart told him something else that the boy had never noticed: it told the boy of dangers that had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls9d ws0">threatened him, but that he had never perceived. His heart said that one time it had hidden the rifle the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls10c ws0">boy had taken from his father, because of the possibility that the boy might wound himself. And it</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls483 ws0">reminded the boy of the day when he had been ill and vomiting out in the fields, after which he had fallen</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls87 ws0">into a deep sleep. There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy&apos;s sheep</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls430 ws0">and murder him. But, since the boy hadn&apos;t passed by, they had decided to move on, thinking that he had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls484 ws0">changed his route.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls43f ws0"> &quot;Does a man&apos;s heart always help him?&quot; the boy asked the alchemist.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls355 ws0"> &quot;Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies.

He had been so far away that his face</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsed ws0">wasn&apos;t even visible.

In the distant land the boy came from, they called it the levanter,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls127 ws0">because they believed that it brought with it the sands of the desert, and the screams of the Moorish</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4ba ws0">wars.

It was a prayer that he had never</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls420 ws0">said before, because it was a prayer without words or pleas. His prayer didn&apos;t give thanks for his sheep</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsde ws0">having found new pastures; it didn&apos;t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal; and it didn&apos;t beseech</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls155 ws0">that the woman he had met continue to await his return.

I can now grant you any wish you desire.&apos;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y29 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsf7 ws0"> &quot; &apos;Life was good to me,&apos; the man said. &apos;When you appeared in my dream, I felt that all my efforts had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4d4 ws0">been rewarded, because my son&apos;s poems will be read by men for generations to come. I don&apos;t want</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls365 ws0">anything for myself. But any father would be proud of the fame achieved by one whom he had cared for</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls235 ws0">as a child, and educated as he grew up. Sometime in the distant future, I would like to see my son&apos;s</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4f1 ws0">words.&apos;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lscb ws0"> &quot;The angel touched the man&apos;s shoulder, and they were both projected far into the future.

But when the reign of Tiberius ended, his poems were forgotten. The words</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls33 ws0">you&apos;re hearing now are those of your son in the military.&apos;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls11a ws0"> &quot;The man looked at the angel in surprise.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4f2 ws0"> &quot; &apos;Your son went to serve at a distant place, and became a centurion. He was just and good. One</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls97 ws0">afternoon, one of his servants fell ill, and it appeared that he would die. Your son had heard of a rabbi</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3a6 ws0">who was able to cure illnesses, and he rode out for days and days in search of this man. Along the way,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3b2 ws0">he learned that the man he was seeking was the Son of God. He met others who had been cured by him,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls411 ws0">and they instructed your son in the man&apos;s teachings. And so, despite the fact that he was a Roman</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4ba ws0">centurion, he converted to their faith. Shortly thereafter, he reached the place where the man he was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4f3 ws0">looking for was visiting.&apos;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls6d ws0"> &quot; &apos;He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill, and the rabbi made ready to go to his house</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls194 ws0">with him. But the centurion was a man of faith, and, looking into the eyes of the rabbi, he knew that he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4f4 ws0">was surely in the presence of the Son of God.&apos;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1f ws0"> &quot; &apos;And this is what your son said,&apos; the angel told the man. &apos;These are the words he said to the rabbi at</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls407 ws0">that point, and they have never been forgotten: &quot;My Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4dd ws0">my roof.

It</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsb5 ws0">was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y47 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1da ws0"> &quot;Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,&quot; the alchemist had told him.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2fa ws0"> But his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the story of a shepherd who had left his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y48 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls376 ws0">flock to follow a dream he had on two different occasions. It told of destiny, and of the many men who</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls46a ws0">had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful women, confronting the people of their times with</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls19c ws0">their preconceived notions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and change.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls33c ws0"> As he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered, &quot;Be aware of the place where you are</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y51 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4f6 ws0">brought to tears. That&apos;s where I am, and that&apos;s where your treasure is.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y52 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls297 ws0"> The boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the starry sky: it had been a month since he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4eb ws0">had set forth from the oasis. The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes, creating the appearance of a</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y49 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls335 ws0">rolling sea; it reminded the boy of the day when that horse had reared in the desert, and he had come to</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls476 ws0">know the alchemist. And the moon fell on the desert&apos;s silence, and on a man&apos;s journey in search of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2f7 ws0">treasure.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls132 ws0"> When he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There, illuminated by the light of the moon and the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y36 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls145 ws0">brightness of the desert, stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5b ws0"> The boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making him believe in his destiny, and for</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4f7 ws0">leading him to meet a king, a merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all for his having met</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b5 ws0">a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his destiny.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2b7 ws0"> If he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to Fatima, and live his life as a simple</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4f8 ws0">shepherd. After all, the alchemist continued to live in the desert, even though he understood the Language</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls367 ws0">of the World, and knew how to transform lead into gold. He didn&apos;t need to demonstrate his science and</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5c ws0">art to anyone. The boy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own destiny, he had learned all</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls7e ws0">he needed to know, and had experienced everything he might have dreamed of.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls192 ws0"> But here he was, at the point of finding his treasure, and he reminded himself that no project is</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls417 ws0">completed until its objective has been achieved. The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw that,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4f9 ws0">where his tears had fallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling through the sand. During his time in the desert, he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4fa ws0">had learned that, in Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of God.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y42 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2cc ws0"> Another omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so, he thought of what the crystal</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsd7 ws0">merchant had once said: that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard.

He felt weighted down</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y23 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1c8 ws0">by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built. But he didn&apos;t stop. He struggled to continue</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4fb ws0">digging as he fought the wind, which often blew the sand back into the excavation. His hands were</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y25 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e ws0">abraded and exhausted, but he listened to his heart. It had told him to dig where his tears fell.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y26 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e2 ws0"> As he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered, he heard footsteps. Several figures</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y45 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls156 ws0">approached him. Their backs were to the moonlight, and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y27 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls83 ws0">faces.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y28 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls43f ws0"> &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; one of the figures demanded.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y46 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4fc ws0"> Because he was terrified, the boy didn&apos;t answer. He had found where his treasure was, and was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4fd ws0">frightened at what might happen.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d6 ws0"> &quot;We&apos;re refugees from the tribal wars, and we need money,&quot; the other figure said. &quot;What are you hiding</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4fe ws0">there?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4ff ws0"> &quot;I&apos;m not hiding anything,&quot; the boy answered.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y2f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2b9 ws0"> But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole. Another, who was searching the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y30 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls500 ws0">boy&apos;s bags, found the piece of gold.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y31 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls17c ws0"> &quot;There&apos;s gold here,&quot; he said.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y32 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls44 ws0"> The moon shone on the face of the Arab who had seized him, and in the man&apos;s eyes the boy saw death.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y33 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls405 ws0"> &quot;He&apos;s probably got more gold hidden in the ground.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y34 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls292 ws0"> They made the boy continue digging, but he found nothing. As the sun rose, the men began to beat the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y35 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls216 ws0">boy. He was bruised and bleeding, his clothing was torn to shreds, and he felt that death was near.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y37 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls40f ws0"> &quot;What good is money to you if you&apos;re going to die? It&apos;s not often that money can save someone&apos;s life,&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y38 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls18e ws0">the alchemist had said. Finally, the boy screamed at the men, &quot;I&apos;m digging for treasure!&quot; And, although his</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y39 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls488 ws0">mouth was bleeding and swollen, he told his attackers that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls91 ws0">near the Pyramids of Egypt.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls501 ws0"> The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others: &quot;Leave him. He doesn&apos;t</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls356 ws0">have anything else. He must have stolen this gold.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1d6 ws0"> The boy fell to the sand, nearly unconscious. The leader shook him and said, &quot;We&apos;re leaving.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y3e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls200 ws0"> But before they left, he came back to the boy and said, &quot;You&apos;re not going to die.

Two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent dream,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y53 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls195 ws0">too. I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and look for a ruined church where shepherds</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y40 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls503 ws0">and their sheep slept. In my dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the sacristy, and I</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y4e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls251 ws0">was told that, if I dug at the roots of the sycamore, I would find a hidden treasure. But I&apos;m not so stupid</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y41 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2dd ws0">as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream.&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y43 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b1 ws0"> And they disappeared.</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

They seemed to laugh at him, and he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y22 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls20 ws0">laughed back, his heart bursting with joy.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y24 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls43a ws0"> Because now he knew where his treasure was.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h5 y77 ff1 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls504 ws0"> EPILOGUE</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y78 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls505 ws0"> The boy reached the small, abandoned church just as night was falling. The sycamore was still there in</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y79 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3e3 ws0">the sacristy, and the stars could still be seen through the half-destroyed roof. He remembered the time he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y7a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls8b ws0">had been there with his sheep; it had been a peaceful night… except for the dream.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y7b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls273 ws0"> Now he was here not with his flock, but with a shovel.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y7c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls417 ws0"> He sat looking at the sky for a long time. Then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine, and drank</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y7d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsbb ws0">some. He remembered the night in the desert when he had sat with the alchemist, as they looked at the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y7e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls21a ws0">stars and drank wine together. He thought of the many roads he had traveled, and of the strange way</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y7f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2eb ws0">God had chosen to show him his treasure. If he hadn&apos;t believed in the significance of recurrent dreams, he</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y80 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1b8 ws0">would not have met the Gypsy woman, the king, the thief, or… &quot;Well, it&apos;s a long list. But the path was</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y81 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2cb ws0">written in the omens, and there was no way I could go wrong,&quot; he said to himself.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y82 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls3f8 ws0"> He fell asleep, and when he awoke the sun was already high. He began to dig at the base of the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y83 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsa0 ws0">sycamore.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y84 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls27c ws0"> &quot;You old sorcerer,&quot; the boy shouted up to the sky. &quot;You knew the whole story. You even left a bit of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y85 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5d ws0">gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church. The monk laughed when he saw me come back</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y86 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 lsbf ws0">in tatters. Couldn&apos;t you have saved me from that?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y87 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls366 ws0"> &quot;No,&quot; he heard a voice on the wind say. &quot;If I had told you, you wouldn&apos;t have seen the Pyramids.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y88 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls361 ws0">They&apos;re beautiful, aren&apos;t they?&quot;</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y89 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls4d2 ws0"> The boy smiled, and continued digging. Half an hour later, his shovel hit something solid. An hour later,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y8a ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e7 ws0">he had before him a chest of Spanish gold coins. There were also precious stones, gold masks adorned</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y8b ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls15c ws0">with red and white feathers, and stone statues embedded with jewels. The spoils of a conquest that the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y8c ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls132 ws0">country had long ago forgotten, and that some conquistador had failed to tell his children about.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y8d ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls326 ws0"> The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag. He had used the two stones only once, one morning</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y8e ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls506 ws0">when he was at a marketplace. His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y8f ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls507 ws0"> He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest. They were also a part of his new treasure, because they</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y90 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls132 ws0">were a reminder of the old king, whom he would never see again.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y91 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls149 ws0"> It&apos;s true; life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny, the boy thought. Then he remembered</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y92 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls346 ws0">that he had to get to Tarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy woman, as he had</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y93 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1e2 ws0">promised. Those Gypsies are really smart, he thought. Maybe it was because they moved around so</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y94 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls508 ws0">much.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h4 y95 ff2 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls5b ws0"> The wind began to blow again.
