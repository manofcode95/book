<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:174.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and interests. Thus Margo's luggage contained a multitude of diaphanous garments, three books on</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:326.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">were passed, leaving only confused memories. The tiny ship throbbed away from the heel of Italy out</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:392.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The sea lifted smooth blue muscles of wave as it stirred in the dawn-light, and the foam of our wake</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:421.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">with yellow on the eastern horizon. Ahead lay a chocolate-brown smudge of land, huddled in mist, with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:436.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">a frill of foam at its base. This was Corfu, and we strained our eyes to make out the exact shapes of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:450.95px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">mountains, to discover valleys, peaks, ravines, and beaches, but it remained a silhouette. Then suddenly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:465.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the sun shifted over the horizon, and the sky turned the smooth enamelled blue of a jay's eye. The</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:552.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">caves. The dark waves lifted our wake and carried it gently towards them, and then, at their very</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:566.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">mouths, it crumpled and hissed thirstily among the rocks. Rounding the cape, we left the mountains,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:581.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and the island sloped gently down, blurred with the silver and green iridescence of olives, with here and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:595.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">past an alley-way in which four scruffy mongrels were lying in the sun. Roger stiffened, glared at them</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:460.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">apprehension and curiosity. Mother faced him, hat on one side of her head, clutching in one hand my</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:560.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Finishing at last, I would slip from the table and saunter towards the gate, where Roger sat gazing at me</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:574.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">with a questioning air. Together we would peer through the wrought-iron gates into the olive-groves</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:589.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">beyond. I would suggest to Roger that perhaps it wasn't worth going out today. He would wag his stump</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:603.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">in hasty denial, and his nose would butt at my hand. No, I would say, I really didn't think we ought to go</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:684.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">sit in the garden with a book. Roger, in desperation, would place a large black paw on the gate, and then</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:713.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">stump working itself into a blur of excitement. This was his trump card, for he knew I could never resist</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:727.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">his ridiculous grin. So I would stop teasing him, fetch my match-boxes and my butterfly net, the garden</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:742.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">gate would creak open and clang shut, and Roger would be off through the olive-groves swiftly as a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">working our way through a maze of blackbird-haunted myrtles, venturing into narrow valleys where the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:98.58px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">cypress-trees cast a cloak of mysterious, inky shadow. He was the perfect companion for an adventure,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:142.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">suddenly, gave a snort that sounded like suppressed laughter, a quick look over, a rapid lick of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:199.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">shifted nearer, gave a gentle, whiny yawn, and then sighed deeply and started to wag his tail. If the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:214.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">matter was of no great importance, we would move on, but if it was something absorbing that had to be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:229.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">pored over, I had only to frown at Roger and he would realize it was going to be a long job. His ears</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:243.42px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would droop, his tail slow down and stop, and he would slouch off to the nearest bush, fling himself</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:294.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of the surrounding countryside. There was, for example, a strange, mentally defective youth with a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:309.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">round face as expressionless as a puffball. He was always dressed in tattered shirt, shiny blue serge</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:323.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">trousers that were rolled up to the knee, and on his head the elderly remains of a bowler hat without a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:338.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">brim. Whenever he saw us he came hurrying through the olives, raised his absurd hat politely, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:352.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">wished us good day in a voice as childish and sweet as a flute. He would stand, watching us without</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:367.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">expression, nodding at any remark I happened to make, for ten minutes or so. Then, raising his hat</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:381.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">politely, he would go off through the trees. Then there was the immensely fat and cheerful Agathi, who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:396.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">lived in a tiny tumbledown cottage high up the hill. She was always sitting outside her house with a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:410.85px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">spindle of sheep's wool, twining and pulling it into coarse thread. She must have been well over seventy,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:425.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">but her hair was still black and lustrous, plaited carefully and wound round a pair of polished cow's</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:439.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">horns, an ornament that some of the older peasant women adopted. As she sat in the sun, like a great</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:454.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">black toad with a scarlet head-dress draped over the cow's horns, the bobbin of wool would rise and fall,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:468.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">twisting like a top, her fingers busy unravelling and plucking, and her drooping mouth with its hedge of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:483.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">broken and discoloured teeth wide open as she sang, loudly and harshly, but with great vigour.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:505.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">It was from Agathi that I learnt some of the most beautiful and haunting of the peasant songs. Sitting on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:520.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">an old tin in the sun, eating grapes or pomegranates from her garden, I would sing with her, and she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:534.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would break off now and then to correct my pronunciation.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:557.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">We sang (verse by verse) the gay, rousing song of the river, Vangelio, and of how it dropped from the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:571.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">mountains, making the gardens rich, the fields fertile, and the trees heavy with fruit. We sang, rolling</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:586.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">our eyes at each other in exaggerated coquetry, the funny little love-song called 'Falsehood'. 'Lies, lies,'</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:600.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">we warbled, shaking our heads, 'all lies, but it is my fault for teaching you to go round the countryside</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:615.23px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">telling people I love you.' Then we would strike a mournful note and sing, perhaps, the slow, lilting song</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:629.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">called 'Why are you leaving me?' We were almost overcome by this one, and would wail out the long,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:644.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">soulful lyrics, our voices quavering. When we came to the last bit, the most heart-rending of all, Agathi</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:658.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would clasp her hands to her great breasts, her black eyes would become misty and sad, and her chins</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:673.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would tremble with emotion. As the last discordant notes of our duet faded away, she would turn to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:687.74px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">me, wiping her nose on the corner of her head-dress.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:156.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">tearing at the undergrowth, had a soothing effect on me, and by the time they had drifted slowly past</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:171.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and the shepherd appeared I was nearly asleep. He stopped and looked at me, leaning heavily on his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:484.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">carried on a conversation with him and he replied with a varied and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:507.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">very clever pantomime. I asked what the rose-beetles were for, and why he had them tied with pieces of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:521.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">cotton. He held his hand out to denote small boys, took one of the lengths of cotton from which a beetle</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:536.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">hung, and whirled it rapidly round his head. Immediately the insect came to life and started on its</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:550.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">planet-like circling of his hat, and he beamed at me.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:573.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Pointing up at the sky, he stretched his arms out and gave a deep nasal buzzing, while he banked and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:587.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">swooped across the road. Aeroplane, any fool could see that. Then he pointed to die beetles, held out</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:602.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">his hand to denote children, and whirled his stock of beetles round his head so that they all started to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:668.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">strange gruntings and tenor squeaks, that appeared to be formed at the back of his throat and expelled</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:156.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that I was English was sufficient, for the islanders had a love and respect for the Englishman out of all</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:288.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">sorrowfully, so we sat in silence and stared at the tortoises crawling heavily and uncertainly about the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:317.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">little tortoise and held up six fingers again. I shook my head and held up five. Roger yawned loudly; he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:331.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was thoroughly bored by his silent bargaining. The Rose-beetle Man picked up the reptile and showed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:426.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">hurried off along the road. When I reached the place where I had to cut down through the olive-groves, I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:441.33px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">stopped and examined my acquisition</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:463.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">carefully. He was undoubtedly the finest tortoise I had ever seen, and worth, in my opinion, at least</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:478.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">twice what I had paid for him. I patted his scaly head with my finger and placed him carefully in my</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:507.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">on the road, but he was doing a little jig, prancing and swaying, his flute warbling, while in the road at</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:602.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">cobbled paths on tip-toe, his head and neck stretched out eagerly. He loved being fed, and would squat</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:631.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">much as Roger did, so there was always great rivalry. Achilles would sit mumbling the grapes in his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:645.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">mouth, the juice running down his chin, and Roger would lie nearby, watching him with agonized eyes,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:660.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">his mouth drooling saliva. Roger always had his fair share of the fruit, but even so he seemed to think it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:674.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">a waste to give such delicacies to a tortoise. When the feeding was over, if I didn't keep an eye on him,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:689.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Roger would creep up to Achilles and lick his front vigorously in an attempt to get the grape-juice that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:703.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the reptile had dribbled down himself. Achilles, affronted at such a liberty, would snap at Roger's nose,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:718.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and then, when the licks became too overpowering and moist, he would retreat into his shell with an</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:755.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">But the fruit that Achilles liked best were wild strawberries. He would become positively hysterical at</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:312.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">running round it. A grove of stunted olives grew there, providing a pleasant shade. From the top of the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:450.95px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">beds of black ribbon-weed, and it was among these beds that the sea-slugs lived. Treading water and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:494.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">among the weed-bed lay the sea-slugs, perhaps the ugliest of the sea fauna. Some six inches long, they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:508.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">looked exactly like overgrown sausages made out of thick, brown, carunculated leather; dim, primitive</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:523.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">beasts that just lie in one spot, rolling gently with the sea's swing, sucking in sea-water at one end of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:537.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">their bodies and passing it out at the other.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:669.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">It was this water-pistol habit of theirs that led us to invent a game. Each armed with a seaslug we would</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:711.74px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">in sheer desperation. He retrieved the stone, dropped it at my feet and backed away expectantly, ears</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:740.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">faintly surprised; he examined the stone carefully, and then looked at me again. I whistled a short tune</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:755.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and looked up into the sky. Roger gave an experimental yap; then, seeing I still took no notice, he</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:281.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">noticed a curious thing. Here and there on the green plush surface of the moss were scattered faint</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:383.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">curious way in which the moss grew. I probed again, more vigorously, and suddenly my stomach gave a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:412.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">whole circle lifted up like a trapdoor. As I stared, I saw to my amazement that it was in fact a trapdoor,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:441.33px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">concealed. The edge of the door was fastened to the lip of the tunnel by a small flap of silk that acted as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:455.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">a hinge. I gazed at this magnificent piece of workmanship and wondered what on earth could have</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:484.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">no response. For a long time I sat staring at this fantastic home, trying to decide what sort of beast had</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:595.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">He picked up a neat grey homburg and placed it squarely on his head. At the door he held out his hand</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:696.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">amazed by Theodore. First, since he was obviously a scientist of considerable repute (and I could have</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:725.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">met until now who seemed to share my enthusiasm for zoology. Secondly, I was extremely flattered to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:740.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">find that he treated me and talked to me exactly as though I was his own age. I liked him for this, as I</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:455.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Margo was always badly affected by the spring. Her personal appearance, always of absorbing interest</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:498.95px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would drift about the villa, carrying piles of flimsy underwear or bottles of scent. She would seize every</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:527.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">dislodge as a limpet from a rock. The family in turn would bellow and batter on the door, getting no</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:542.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">more satisfaction than an assurance that she was nearly finished, an assurance which we had learnt by</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:585.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">during one of these excursions to the sea that she met an over-good-looking young Turk. With unusual</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:664.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">had to keep pressing myself against the seat. I think he noticed, though... he kept giving me funny looks</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:678.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">from the corner of his eye. Then in the interval he went out and came back with some of that horrible,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:69.52px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">with faded daffodil-yellow walls, green shutters, and a fox-red roof. It stood on a hill overlooking the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:142.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">sunken garden that ran along one side of the house, its wrought-iron gates scabby with rust, had roses,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:156.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">anemones, and geraniums sprawling across the weed-grown paths, and the shaggy, untended</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:375.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that simmered beneath the lemon-trees. In a moment of misguided enthusiasm Mother engaged the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:389.85px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">gardener's wife to work for us in the villa. Her name was Lugaretzia, and she was a thin, lugubrious</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:418.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">kept it attached to her skull. She was extremely sensitive, as Mother soon discovered, and the slightest</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:447.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">embarrassing display of grief. It was such a heart-rending sight to watch that Mother very soon gave up</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:462.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">criticizing her altogether.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:499.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">her spaniel eyes, and that was a discussion of her ailments. Where most people are hypochondriacs as a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:513.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">hobby, Lugaretzia had turned it into a full-time occupation. When we took up residence it was her</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:528.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">stomach that was worrying her.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:565.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">She would move from room to room with the trays, giving each one of us a blow-by-blow account of her</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:253.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I grew to know these swallow families very well, and watched their daily work with considerable</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:281.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">over-anxious, and fussy. The two males, on the other hand, displayed totally different characters. One of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:296.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">them, during the work of lining the nest, brought excellent material, but he refused to treat it as a job of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:311.01px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">work. He would come swooping home, carrying a wisp of sheep's wool in his mouth, and would waste</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:325.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">several minutes skating low over the flowers in the garden, drawing, figures of eight, or else weaving in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:339.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and out of the columns that held up the grape-vine. His wife would cling to the nest and chitter at him</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:354.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">exasperatedly, but he refused to take life seriously. The other female also had trouble with her mate,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:368.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">but it was trouble of a different sort. He was, if anything, over-enthusiastic. He seemed determined to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:383.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">leave no stone unturned in his efforts to provide his young with the finest nest-lining in the colony. But,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:397.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">unfortunately, he was no mathematician, and, try as he would, he could not remember the size of his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:412.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">nest. He would come flying back, twittering in an excited if somewhat muffled manner, carrying a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:449.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">It would generally take his wife several minutes to convince him that, no matter how they struggled and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:463.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">juggled, the feather would not fit into the nest. Acutely disappointed he would eventually drop the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:492.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">off in search of something more suitable. In a little while he would be back, struggling under a load of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:566.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">characters seemed to change. The one who had brought so much futile nest-lining now swooped and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:581.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">hawked about the hillsides in a carefree manner and would come drifting back carelessly carrying a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:610.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">other male now became terribly harassed and apparently a prey to the dreadful thought that his babies</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:624.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">might starve. So he would wear himself to a shadow in the pursuit of food, and return carrying the most</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:639.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">unsuitable items, such as large spiky beetles, all legs and wing-case, and immense, dry, and completely</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:653.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">indigestible dragon-flies. He would cling to the edge of the nest and make valiant but vain attempts to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:668.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">get these gigantic offerings rammed down the ever-open gullet of his young. I dread to think what</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:682.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would have happened if he had succeeded in wedging one of these spiky captures down their throats.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">to see for the first time the hygienic arrangements of a bird's nest. I had often wondered, when hand-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:98.58px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">rearing a young bird, why it hoisted its bottom skywards with much waggling when it wanted to excrete.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:113.10px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Now I discovered the reason.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:135.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The excreta of the baby swallows was produced in globules which were coated with mucus</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:157.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that formed what was almost a gelatine packet round the dropping. The young would stand on their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:172.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">heads, waggle their bottoms in a brief but enthusiastic rumba, and deposit their little offerings on the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:187.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">rim of the nest. When the females arrived they would cram the food they had collected down the gaping</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:201.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">throats, and then delicately pick up the dropping in their beaks and fly off to deposit it somewhere over</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:215.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the olive-groves. It was an admirable arrangement, and I would watch the whole performance</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:230.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">fascinated, from the bottomwaggle - which always made me giggle - to the final swoop of the parent</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:267.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Owing to the male swallow's habit of collecting strange and unsuitable insects for his young, I always</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:281.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">used to examine the area below the nest twice a day, in the hope of finding new specimens to add to my</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:296.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">collection. It was here that, one morning, I found the most extraordinary-looking beetle crawling about.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:311.01px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I did not think that even that mentally defective swallow could have brought back such a large creature,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:383.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">toyed with the idea that it may have found itself without a pair of clean wing-cases to put on that</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:412.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">enchanting, could not be described as scientific.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:434.85px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I noticed, after I had picked it up, that my fingers smelled faintly acrid and oily, though it had not</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:500.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Now that the warm days of spring had arrived, Theodore would come out to the villa every Thursday for</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:529.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">making a strange contrast to the nets, bags, and boxes full of testtubes with which he was surrounded.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:558.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">wander about the grounds in search of creatures, or else make what Theodore would call an excursion</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:573.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">to some neighbouring pond or ditch in search of new microscopic life for Theodore's collection. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:587.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">identified my strange beetle, with its ill-fitting electra, without much trouble, and proceeded to tell me</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:442.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">to be absorbing sunshine through every bit of his body and shell. He remained lying there for about ten</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:529.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and he sat there munching happily, his mouth stained with the first food of the year.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:603.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">magnificent, and the blooms were full and thick. Feverishly he set to work, and by the end of the first</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:222.42px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">surprise, in spite of all remedies, he got worse. While he could still speak, we questioned him</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:429.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">searched the room, but there was no cat hidden anywhere. I indignantly denied Larry's accusation that I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:444.47px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">had smuggled a horse into the house. It was only when Michael seemed on the verge of death that we</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:458.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">noticed the horse-rug, which Mother had tucked carefully under his chin. This incident had such a bad</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:648.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was of a much more unladylike character. At the first available opportunity she got Larry into a corner.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:180.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the house was a rich hunting ground for me. It was an ancient brick wall that had been plastered over,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:195.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">but now this outer skin was green with moss, bulging and sagging with the damp of many winters.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:217.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The whole surface was an intricate map of cracks, some several inches wide, others as fine as hairs. Here</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:232.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and there large pieces had dropped off and revealed the rows of rose-pink bricks lying beneath like ribs.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:246.42px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">There was a whole landscape on this wall if you peered closely enough to see it; the roofs of a hundred</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:333.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">grew a mass of plants, cyclamen, crocus, asphodel, thrusting their leaves among the piles of broken and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:347.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">chipped roof-tiles that lay there. This whole strip was guarded by a labyrinth of blackberry hung, in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:500.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of inhabitants. Here it was more difficult to differentiate between the prey and the predators, for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:515.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">everything seemed to feed indiscriminately off everything else. Thus the hunting wasps searched out</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:529.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">caterpillars and spiders; the spiders hunted for flies; the dragon-flies, big, brittle, and hunting-pink, fed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:653.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">tail like a string of brown beads ending in a sting like a rose-thorn. The scorpion would lie there quite</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:668.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">quietly as you examined him, only raising his tail in an almost apologetic</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:98.58px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">quite a bit about the scorpions. I found that they would eat bluebottles (though how they caught them</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:113.10px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was a mystery I never solved), grass-hoppers, moths, and lacewing flies. Several times I found them</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:164.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">scorpions' wonderful courtship dances. I saw them standing, claws clasped, their bodies raised to the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:193.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">in claw. But my view of these performances was all too short, for almost as soon as I switched on the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:236.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">beasts that believed in keeping themselves to themselves. If I could have kept a colony in captivity I</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:302.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">pale fawn fur coat. Closer inspection proved that this strange garment was made up of a mass of tiny</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:317.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">babies clinging to the mother's back. I was enraptured by this family, and I made up my mind to smuggle</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:484.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Now I maintain to this day that the female scorpion meant no harm. She was agitated and a trifle</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:135.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">above the ether and methylated spirits. Poor Roger was wrongly accused at first, and it was only later,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:150.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">when the smell had penetrated even to Larry's bedroom, that a thorough investigation traced the odour</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:164.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">to my bat. I was surprised and not a little annoyed. Under pressure I was forced to get rid of it. Peter</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:178.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">explained that I had not cured it properly, and said that if I could obtain another specimen he would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:193.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">show me the correct procedure. I thanked him profusely, but tactfully suggested that we keep the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:208.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">whole thing a secret; I explained that I felt the family now looked with a suspicious eye on the art of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:222.42px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">taxidermy, and it would require a lot of tedious persuasion to get them into an agreeable frame of mind.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:244.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">My efforts to secure another bat were unsuccessful. Armed with a long bamboo I waited for hours in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:259.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">moon-splashed corridors between the olive-trees, but the bats flickered past like quicksilver and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:273.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">vanished before I could use my weapon. But, while waiting in vain for a chance to hit a bat, I saw a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:288.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">number of other night creatures which I would not otherwise have seen. I watched a young fox</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:302.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">hopefully digging for beetles in the hillside, scrabbling with slim paws at the earth, and scrunching the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:317.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">insects up hungrily as he unearthed them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:339.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Once, five jackals appeared out of the murtle bushes, paused in surprise at seeing me, and then melted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:354.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">among the trees, like shadows. The nightjars on silent, silky wings would slide as smoothly as great black</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:368.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">swallows along the rows of olives, sweeping across the grass in pursuit of the drunken, whirling crane-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:383.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">flies. One night a pair of squirrel dormice appeared in the tree above me, and chased each other in wild</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:397.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">exuberance up and down the grove, leaping from branch to branch like acrobats, skittering up and down</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:412.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the tree-trunks, their bushy tails like puffs of grey smoke in the moonlight. I was so fascinated by these</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:426.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">creatures that I was determined to try to catch one. The best time to search for them was, of course,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:441.33px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">during the day, when they would be asleep. So, I hunted laboriously through the olive-groves for their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:455.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">hideout, but it was a hopeless quest, for every gnarled and twisted trunk was hollow, and each</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:470.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">contained half a dozen holes. However, my patience did not go entirely unrewarded, for one day I thrust</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:484.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">my arm into a hole, and my fingers closed round something small and soft, something that wiggled as I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:499.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">pulled it out. At first glance my capture appeared to be an outsize bundle of dandelion seeds, furnished</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:513.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">with a pair of enormous golden eyes; closer inspection proved it to be a young Scops owl, still clad in his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:528.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">baby down. We regarded each other for a moment, and then the bird, apparently indignant at my ill-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:542.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">mannered laughter at his appearance, dug his tiny claws deeply into my thumb, and I lost my grip on the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:557.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">branch, so that we fell out of the tree together.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:579.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I carried the indignant owlet back home in my pocket, and introduced him to the family with a certain</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:594.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">trepidation. To my surprise, he was greeted with unqualified approval, and no objection was raised to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:608.75px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">my keeping him. He took up residence in a basket kept in my study and, after much argument, he was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:623.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">christened Ulysses. From the first he showed that he was a bird of great strength of character, and not</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:637.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">to be trifled with. Although he would have fitted comfortably into a tea-cup, he showed no fear and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:652.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would unhesitatingly attack anything and everyone, regardless of size. As we all had to share the room, I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:666.74px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">felt it would be a good idea if he and Roger got on intimate terms, so, as soon as the owl had settled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:681.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">down, I performed the introductions by placing Ulysses on the floor, and telling Roger to approach and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:695.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">make friends. Roger had become very philosophical about having to make friends with the various</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:710.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">creatures that I adopted, and he took the appearance of an owl in his stride. Wagging his tail briskly, in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:724.70px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">an ingratiating manner, he approached Ulysses, who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:747.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">squatted on the floor with anything but a friendly expression on his face. He watched Roger's approach</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:761.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">in an unwinking stare of ferocity. Roger's advance became less confident. Ulysses continued to glare as</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:69.52px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">glanced at me for inspiration. I ordered him sternly to continue his overtures of friendship. Roger looked</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">nervously at the owl, and then with great nonchalance walked round him, in an effort to approach him</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:113.10px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">never having met a creature that could look behind itself without turning round, seemed a trifle</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:127.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">nonplussed. After a moment's thought he decided to try the skittish, let's-all-have-a-jolly-game</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:171.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">stuffed. Roger, still progressing on his stomach, managed to get quite close, but then he made a fatal</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:185.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">mistake. He pushed his woolly face forward and sniffed loudly and interestedly at the bird. Now Ulysses</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:199.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would stand a lot, but he was not going to be sniffed at by a mountainous dog covered with black curls.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:214.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">He decided that he would have to show this ungainly and wingless beast exactly where he got off. He</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:360.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">forced to give him the run of the study. He performed his flying lessons between the table and the door-</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:426.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would open his eyes a fraction, raise his ear-tufts, and elongate his whole body, so that he looked like</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:492.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">wake up. He would yawn delicately, stretch his wings, clean his tail, and then shiver violently so that all</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:507.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">his feathers stood out like the petals of a wind-blown chrysanthemum. With great nonchalance he</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:558.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Having prepared himself for the night's work, he would utter an experimental 'tywhoo ?' to make sure</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:631.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was the signal that he wanted the shutters opened. As soon as I threw them back he would float out</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:397.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">set the moonlight shaking across the waters of the bay. When tired, we swam languidly to the shore and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:412.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">lay on the warm rocks, gazing up into the star-freckled sky. Generally after half an hour or so I would get</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:426.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">bored with the conversation, and slip back into the water and swim slowly out across the bay, to lie on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:441.33px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">my back, cushioned by the warm sea, gazing up at the moon. One night, while I was thus occupied, I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:455.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">discovered that our bay was used by other creatures as well.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:507.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">how many stars it contained. I could hear the voices of the others, laughing and talking on the beach,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:558.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">dreamy, I was suddenly startled to hear, quite close to me, a clop and gurgle of water, followed by a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:573.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">long, deep sigh, and a series of gentle ripples rocked me up and down. Hastily I righted myself and trod</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:587.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">water, looking to see how far from the beach I had drifted. To my alarm I found that not only was I some</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:602.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">considerable distance from the shore, but from the Sea Cow as well, and I was not at all sure what sort</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:645.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that curved over and extinguished itself at the rim of the sea. I was feeling more and more</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:660.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">uncomfortable, and I was just about to call for assistance when, some twenty feet away from me, the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:689.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">sigh, and sank below the surface again. I had hardly time to recognize it as a porpoise before I found I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:703.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was right in the midst of them. They rose all around me, sighing luxuriously, their black backs shining as</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:69.52px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">spot. Presently, as if obeying a signal, they turned and headed out of the bay towards the distant coast</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of Albania, and I trod water and watched them go, swimming up the white chain of moonlight, backs</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:222.42px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">phosphorescence was when there was no moon at all. Another illuminated inhabitant of the summer</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:266.01px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">goldengreen, as the sea was. Again, however, the fireflies were at their best when there was no bright</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:317.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">For some time Mother had greatly envied us our swimming, both in the daytime and at night, but, as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:331.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">she pointed out when we suggested she join us, she was far too old for that sort of thing. Eventually,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:346.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">however, under constant pressure from us, Mother paid a visit into town and returned to the villa coyly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:360.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">bearing a mysterious parcel. Opening this she astonished us all by holding up an extraordinary shapeless</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:375.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">garment of black cloth, covered from top to bottom with hundreds of frills and pleats and tucks.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:397.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Well, what d'you think of it?' Mother asked.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:420.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">We stared at the odd garment and wondered what it was for.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:442.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'What is it?' asked Larry at length.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:465.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'It's a bathing-costume, of course,' said Mother͘ 'What on earth did you think it was?’</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:143.58px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">greeted by this strange apparition clad in its voluminous black costume rippling with frills, he retreated</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:157.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">hurriedly through the door, backwards, barking ferociously. It was some time before we could persuade</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:172.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">him that it really was Mother, and even then he kept giving her vaguely uncertain looks from the corner</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:187.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of his eye. However, in spite of all opposition, Mother stuck to her tent-like bathing-suit, and in the end</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:201.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">we gave up.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:223.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">In order to celebrate her first entry into the sea we decided to have a moonlight picnic down at the bay,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:238.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and sent an invitation to Theodore, who was the only stranger that Mother would tolerate on such a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:253.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">great occasion. The day for the great immersion arrived, food and wine were prepared, the boat was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:267.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">cleaned out and filled with cushions, and everything was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:290.01px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">ready when Theodore turned up. On hearing that we had planned a moonlight picnic and swim he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:304.53px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">reminded us that on that particular night there was no moon. Everyone blamed everyone else for not</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:318.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">having checked on the moon's progress, and the argument went on until dusk. Eventually we decided</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:333.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that we would go on the picnic in spite of everything, since all the arrangements were made, so we</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:347.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">staggered down to the boat, loaded down with food, wine, towels, and cigarettes, and set off down the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:362.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">coast. Theodore and I sat in the bows as look-outs, and the rest took it in turn to row while Mother</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:376.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">steered. To begin with, her eyes not having become accustomed to the dark, Mother skilfully steered us</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:391.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">in a tight circle, so that after ten minutes' strenuous rowing the jetty suddenly loomed up and we ran</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:405.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">into it with a splintering crash. Unnerved by this, Mother went to the opposite extreme and steered out</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:420.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">to sea, and we would eventually have made a landfall somewhere on the Albanian coastline if Leslie had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:434.85px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">not noticed in time. After this Margo took over the steering, and she did it quite well, except that she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:449.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would, in a crisis, get flurried and forget</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:471.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that to turn right one had to put the tiller over to the left. The result was that we had to spend ten</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:486.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">minutes straining and tugging at the boat which Margo had, in her excitement, steered on to, instead of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:500.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">away from, a rock. Taken all round it was an auspicious start to Mother's first bathe.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:523.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Eventually we reached the bay, spread out the rugs on the sand, arranged the food, placed the battalion</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:537.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of wine-bottles in a row in the shallows to keep cool, and the great moment had arrived. Amid much</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:552.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">cheering Mother removed her housecoat and stood revealed in all her glory, clad in the bathing-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:566.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">costume which made her look, as Larry pointed out, like a sort of marine Albert Memorial. Roger</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:581.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">behaved very well until he saw Mother wade into the shallow water in a slow and dignified manner. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:595.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">then got terribly excited. He seemed to be under the impression that the bathing-costume was some</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:610.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">sort of sea monster that had enveloped Mother and was now about to carry her out to sea. Barking</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:624.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">wildly, he flung himself to the rescue, grabbed -one of the frills dangling so plentifully round the edge of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:455.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">farther down the coast. Then the porpoises lined up and sped out to sea, leaving a flaming path behind</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:507.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">required too much effort to row the Sea Cow down the coast to our bathing bay, so we invested in an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:521.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">outboard engine. The acquisition of this machine opened up a vast area of coastland for us, for we could</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:550.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">beaches golden as corn, or lying like fallen moons among the contorted rocks. It was thus that I became</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:565.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">aware of the fact that, stretching along the coast for miles, was a scattered archipelago of small islands,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:594.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">on top. For some reason, which I could not discover, the sea faunae were greatly attracted by this</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:55.00px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">struck with a brilliant idea: my birthday was due fairly soon, and if I dealt with the family skilfully I felt</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that, instead of letting them choose my birthday presents, I might tell them the things which I wanted</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:113.10px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and then, somewhat suspiciously, asked me what I wanted. Innocently, I said that I hadn't thought about</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:142.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">on it.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:164.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">My list took a lot of time and thought to work out, and a considerable amount of applied psychology.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:222.42px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">microscope. Margo's list was a little more difficult, for the items had to be chosen so that they would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:236.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">encourage her to go to her favourite shops. So from her I asked for ten yards of butter muslin, ten yards</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:251.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of white calico, six large packets of pins, two bundles of cotton wool, two pints of ether, a pair of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:266.01px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">forceps, and two fountain-pen fillers. It was, I realized resignedly, quite useless to ask Larry for anything</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:280.53px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">like formalin or pins, but if my list showed some sort of literary leaning I stood a good chance.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:294.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Accordingly I made out a formidable sheet covered with the titles, authors' names, publishers, and price</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:309.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of all the natural history books I felt in need of, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:331.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">put an asterisk against those that would be most gratefully received. Since I had only one request left, I</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:360.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">moment with care. I had to wait some days for what I considered to be a propitious moment.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:383.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I had just helped him to the successful conclusion of some ballistic experiments he was making, which</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:397.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">involved tying an ancient muzzle-loader to a tree and firing it by means of a long string attached to the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:412.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">trigger. At the fourth attempt we achieved what apparently Leslie considered to be success: the barrel</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:426.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">burst and bits of metal whined in all directions.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:449.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Leslie was delighted and made copious notes on the back of an envelope. Together we set about picking</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:463.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">up the remains of the gun. While we were thus engaged I casually asked him what he would like to give</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:478.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">me for my birthday.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:500.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Hadn't thought about it,' he replied absently, examining with evident satisfaction a contorted piece of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:537.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I said I wanted a boat. Leslie, realizing how he had been trapped, said indignantly that a boat was far too</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:581.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">expensive. I said that when one said anything one meant anything, which included boats, and anyway I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:595.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">didn't expect him to buy me one.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:677.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">But it's the time. It would take ages and ages to do. Look, wouldn't it be better if I took you out in the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:259.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">three-fold. Firstly, they wanted to purchase my presents. Secondly, the larder had to be stocked up. We</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:273.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">had agreed that we would not invite a lot of people to the party; we said we didn't like crowds, and so</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:288.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">ten guests, carefully selected, were the most we were prepared to put up with. It would be a small but</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:302.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">distinguished gathering of people we liked best. Having unanimously decided on this, each member of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:317.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the family then proceeded to invite ten people. Unfortunately they didn't all invite the same ten, with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:331.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the exception of Theodore, who received five separate invitations. The result was that Mother, on the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:346.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">eve of the party, suddenly discovered we were going to have not ten guests but forty-five. The third</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:360.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">reason for going to town was to make sure that Lugaretzia attended the dentist.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:383.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Recently her teeth had been her chief woe, and Doctor Androuchelli, having peered into her mouth, had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:397.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">uttered a series of popping noises indicative of horror, and said that she must have all her teeth out,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:412.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">since it was obvious that they were the cause of all her ailments. After a week's arguing, accompanied</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:426.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">by floods of tears, we managed to get Lugaretzia to consent, but she had refused to go without moral</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:441.33px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">support. So, bearing her, white and weeping, in our midst, we swept into town.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:463.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">We returned in the evening, exhausted and irritable, the car piled high with food, and Lugaretzia lying</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:478.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">across our laps like a corpse, moaning frightfully. It was perfectly obvious that she would be in no</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:492.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">condition to assist with the cooking and other work on the morrow.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:515.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Spiro, when asked to suggest a solution, gave his usual answer.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:560.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The following morning was full of incident. Lugaretzia had recovered sufficiently to undertake light</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:589.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">describing in detail the agonies she had suffered with each individual tooth. My presents having been</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:603.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">duly inspected and the family thanked, I then went round to the back veranda with Leslie, and there lay</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:618.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">a mysterious shape covered with a tarpaulin. Leslie drew this aside with the air of a conjurer, and there</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:632.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">lay my boat. I gazed at it rapturously; it was surely the most perfect boat that anyone had ever had.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:647.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Gleaming in her coat of new paint she lay there, my steed to the enchanted archipelago.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:669.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The boat was some seven feet long, and almost circular in shape. Leslie explained hurriedly - in case I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:684.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">thought the shape was due to defective craftsmanship - that the reason for this was that the planks had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:698.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">been too short for the frame, an explanation I found perfectly satisfactory. After all, it was the sort of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:713.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">irritating thing that could have happened to anyone. I said stoutly that I thought it was a lovely shape for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:727.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">a boat, and indeed I thought it was. She was not sleek, slim, and rather predatory looking, like most</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:742.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">boats, but rotund, placid, and somehow comforting in her circular solidarity. She reminded me of an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:756.74px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">earnest dungbeetle, an insect for which I had great affection. Leslie, pleased at my evident delight, said</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:69.52px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">reasons, this was the safest. I said that I liked flat-bottomed boats the best, because it was possible to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">put jars of specimens on the floor without so much risk of them upsetting.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:106.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Leslie asked me if I liked the colour scheme, as he had not been too sure about it. Now, in my opinion,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:121.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the colour scheme was the best thing about it, the final touch that completed the unique craft. Inside</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:135.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">she was painted green and white, while her bulging sides were tastefully covered in white, black, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:150.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">brilliant orange stripes, a combination of colours that struck me as being both artistic and friendly. Leslie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:164.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">then showed me the long, smooth cypress pole he had cut for a mast, but explained that it could not be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:178.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">fitted into position until the boat was launched. Enthusiastically I suggested launching her at once.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:193.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Leslie, who was a stickler for procedure, said you couldn't launch a ship without naming her, and had I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:208.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">thought of a name yet? This was a difficult problem, and the whole family were called out to help me</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:222.42px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">solve it. They stood clustered round the boat, which looked like a gigantic flower in their midst, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:236.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">racked their brains.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:259.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Why not call it the Jolly Roger?' suggested Margo.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:281.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I rejected this scornfully; I explained that I wanted a sort of fat name that would go with the boat's</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:341.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">That was no use, either; the boat simply didn't look like an Arbuckle.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:363.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Call it the Ark' said Leslie, but I shook my head.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:386.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">There was another silence while we all stared at the boat. Suddenly I had it, the perfect name: Booth,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:400.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that's what I'd call her.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:490.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I turned Larry's suggestion over in my mind; it was certainly an unusual name, but then so was Bootle.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:505.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">They both seemed to conjure up the shape and personality of the boat. After much thought I decided</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:519.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">what to do. A pot of black paint was produced and laboriously, in rather trickly capitals, I traced her</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:571.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Mother's mind I had to promise that I would only refer to the boat as the Booth in conversation with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:585.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">strangers. The matter of the name being settled, we set about the task of launching her. It took the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:600.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">combined efforts of Margo, Peter, Leslie, and Larry to carry the boat down the hill to the jetty, while</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:629.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">properly. At the end of the jetty the boat-bearers stopped, swaying with exhaustion, and Mother and I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:643.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">struggled with the cork of the wine-bottle.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">confidently on the ripples. She had the faintest suggestion of a list to starboard, but I generously</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:98.58px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">attributed this to the wine and not to Leslie's workmanship.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:262.53px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Peter nodded, braced himself, clasped the mast firmly in both hands, and plunged it into the socket.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:277.05px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Then he stood back, dusted his hands, and the Bootle-Bumtrinket, with a speed remarkable for a craft of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:178.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">spanned, here and there, by narrow plank bridges, most of which were rickety and decayed, but which</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:193.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">were the only means of getting about the swamp. Your time during a hunt was divided between looking</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:532.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">balancing precariously on the swaying bridge, fired both barrels. The gun roared and kicked, the snipe</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:547.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">flew away undamaged, and Larry with a yell of fright fell backwards into the irrigation ditch.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:129.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">In front of the house was a pocket-handkerchief-sized garden, neatly walled, which was a solid tangle of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:143.58px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">wild flowers. The whole garden was overshadowed by a large magnolia tree, the glossy dark green</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:157.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">leaves of which cast a deep shadow. The rutted driveway wound away from the house, down the hillside</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:172.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">through olive-groves, vineyards, and orchards, before reaching the road. We had liked the villa the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:187.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">moment Spiro had shown it to us. It stood, decrepit but immensely elegant, among the drunken olives,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:201.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and looked rather like an eighteenth-century exquisite reclining among a congregation of charladies. Its</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:215.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">charms had been greatly enhanced, from my point of view, by the discovery of a bat in one of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:230.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">rooms, clinging upside down to a shutter and cluttering with dark malevolence. I had hoped that he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:244.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would continue to spend the day in the house, but as soon as we moved in he decided that the place</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:259.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was getting overcrowded and departed to some peaceful olive-trunk.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:333.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">forced me to take notice of them, for the hill-top on which the villa stood contained hundreds, and most</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:347.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of them were much larger than any I had seen before. They squatted disdainfully on the olives, among</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:376.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">whirring into the lamplight with their green wings churning like the wheels of ancient paddle-steamers,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:391.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">to alight on the tables or chairs and stalk mincingly about, turning their heads from side to side in search</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:478.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">wall also considered the house their hunting ground, and so the mantids and the geckos waged a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:492.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">constant war against each other. Most of the battles were mere skirmishes between individual members</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:571.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">curious thing was that, unlike the other geckos, he did not attack the head or body of his enemy. He</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:673.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">sure his rival had departed, Geronimo would then settle down and proceed to eat the tail, a disgusting</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:273.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">decided that the best thing to do would be to capture her so that she could lay her eggs in a box where I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:288.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">could watch over them in comfort. As soon as she realized that I was attempting to capture her, she</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:317.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">upwards in a warning gesture of defiance. Amused at her belligerence towards a creature so much</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:331.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">bigger than herself, I casually caught her round the thorax between finger and thumb. Instantly her long,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:360.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">had been driven through the skin. In my surprise I dropped her and sat back to suck my wound: I found</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:375.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that three of the little punctures had gone really deep, and that, by squeezing, tiny drops of blood</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:389.85px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">appeared. My respect for her increased; she was obviously an insect to be reckoned with. At the next</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:404.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">attempt I was more cautious and used two hands, grabbing her round the thorax with one and holding</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:418.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">on to her dangerous front arms with the other. She wiggled ineffectually, and tried to bite me with her</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:447.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">any effect. I carried her home and imprisoned her in a large gauzecovered cage in my bedroom,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:462.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">tastefully decorated with ferns, heather, and rocks, among which she moved with light-footed grace. I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:476.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">christened her Cicely, for no obvious reason,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:513.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">undiminishing appetite, while her stomach got bigger and bigger. Just when I was certain that at any</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:550.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I was sitting in bed reading one night when, with a great whirring of wings, Cicely flew across the room</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:594.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">astonishment at Cicely. He had, I am sure, never seen such a large mantis before, for Cicely was a good</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:674.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">surprise, Geronimo decided that this impertinent insect would have to be taught a lesson. He wiped his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:703.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">working himself up into a death-defying fury. Cicely took no notice at all, but continued to stare about</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:69.52px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">inspection of the ceiling as if the gecko did not exist. Geronimo edged forward a few inches, and scuffled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">his toes once more, and the tip of his tail twitched. Then he launched himself forward, and a strange</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:98.58px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">thing happened.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:121.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Cicely, who up till then was apparently absorbed in the inspection of a crack in the plaster, leapt</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:135.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">suddenly into the air, turned round, and landed in the same spot, but with her wings spread out like a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:150.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">cloak, reared up on her hindlegs, and curved both serviceable forefeet at the ready. Geronimo had not</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:164.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">been prepared for this spiky reception, and he skidded to a halt about three inches away and stared at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:178.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">her. She returned his stare with one of scornful belligerence. Geronimo seemed a little puzzled by the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:193.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">whole thing; according to his experience the mantis should have taken flight and zoomed away across</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:208.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the room at his approach, and yet here she was standing on end, arms ready to stab, her green cloak of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:222.42px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">wings rustling gently as she swayed from side to side. However, he could not back out now, having got</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:236.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">so far, so he braced himself and leapt in for the kill.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:259.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">His speed and weight told, for he crashed into the mantis and made her reel, and grabbed the underside</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:273.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of her thorax in his jaws. Cicely retaliated by snapping both her front legs shut on Geronimo's hind legs.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:288.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">They rustled and staggered across the ceiling and down the wall, each seeking to gain some advantage.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:302.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Then there was a pause while the contestants had a rest and prepared for the second round, without</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:317.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">either losing their grips. I wondered whether I ought to interfere; I did not want either of them to get</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:331.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">killed, but at the same time the fight was so intriguing that I was loath to separate them. Before I could</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:346.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">decide, they started once again.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:368.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">For some reason or other Cicely was bent on trying to drag Geronimo down the wall to the floor, while</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:383.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">he was equally determined that he should drag her up to the ceiling. They lurched to and fro for some</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:397.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">time, first one and then the other gaining the upper hand, but nothing decisive really happening. Then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:412.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Cicely made her fatal mistake: seizing the opportunity during one of their periodic pauses, she hurled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:426.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">herself into the air in what</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:449.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">seemed to be an attempt to fly across the room with Geronimo dangling from her claws, like an eagle</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:463.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">with a lamb. But she had not taken his weight into consideration. Her sudden leap took the gecko by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:478.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">surprise and tore the suction-pads on his toes free from their grip on the ceiling, but no sooner were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:492.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">they in mid-air than he became a dead weight, and a weight that not even Cicely could cope with. In an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:507.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">intricate tangle of tail and wings they fell on to the bed.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:529.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The fall surprised them both so much that they let go of each other, and sat on the blanket regarding</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:544.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">each other with blazing eyes. Thinking this was a suitable opportunity to come between them and call it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:558.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">a draw, I was just about to grab the contestants when they launched themselves at each other once</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:573.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">again. This time Geronimo was wiser and grasped one of Cicely's sharp forearms in his mouth. She</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:587.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">retaliated by grabbing him round the neck with the other arm. Both were at an equal disadvantage on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:602.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the blanket, for their toes and claws got caught in it and tripped them up. They struggled to and fro</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:616.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">across the bed, and then started to work their way up towards the pillow. By now they were both</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:631.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">looking very much the worse for wear: Cicely had a wing crushed and torn and one leg bent and useless,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:645.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">while Geronimo had a great number of bloody scratches across his back and neck caused by Cicely's</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:660.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">front claws. I was now far too interested to see who was going to win to dream of stopping them, so I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:674.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">vacated the bed as they neared the pillow, for I had no desire to have one of Cicely’s claws dug into my</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:689.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">chest.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:711.74px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">It looked as though the mantis was tiring, but as her feet made contact with the smooth surface of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:726.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">sheet it seemed as if she was given a new lease of life. It was a pity that she applied her new-found</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:740.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">strength towards the wrong objective. She released her grip on Geronimo's neck and seized his tail</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:755.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">instead; whether she thought that by doing so she could hoist him into the air and thus immobolize him,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:769.70px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I don't know, but it had the opposite effect.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:55.00px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">As soon as the claws dug into his tail Geronimo dropped it, but the furious wiggle he gave to accomplish</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:69.52px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">this made his head wag rapidly from side to side, and the result was that he tore Cicely’s forearm off in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">his mouth. So there was Cicely with Geronimo's lashing tail clasped in one claw, while Geronimo tailless</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:135.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">before he spat out his mouthful of arm; but she was too wrapped up in the thrashing tail, which I think</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:150.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">she thought was a vital part of her adversary, and with her one claw she maintained a firm grip on it.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:164.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Geronimo spat out the forearm and leapt forward, his mouth snapped, and Cicely’s head and thorax</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:178.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">disappeared into his mouth.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:201.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">This was really the end of the fight; now it was merely a matter of Geronimo hanging on until Cicely was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:215.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">dead. Her legs twitched, Tier wing unfurled like green fans and rustled crisply as they flapped, her great</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:244.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">bedclothes. For a long time I could not see them; all I could hear was the faint crackle of the mantis's</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:259.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">wings, but presently even this ceased. There was a pause, and then a small, scratched, and bloodstained</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:273.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">head poked above the edge of the sheet, and a pair of golden eyes contemplated me triumphantly as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:288.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Geronimo crawled tiredly into view. A large piece of skin had been torn from his shoulder, leaving a raw,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:302.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">red patch; his back was freckled with beads of blood where the claws had dug into him, and his gory tail-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:317.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">stump left a red smear on the sheet when he moved. He was battered, limp, and exhausted, but</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:331.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">victorious. He sat there for some time, gulping to himself, and allowed me to mop his back with a ball of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:383.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">recovered his strength somewhat, he made his way slowly round the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:420.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">zinnia bed. Obviously he had decided that a good night's rest was needed after such a hectic brawl. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:434.85px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">following night he was back in his usual corner, perky as ever, wagging his stump of a tail with pleasure</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:449.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">as he eyed the feast of insects drifting about the lamp.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:486.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and, to my astonishment, he had with him another gecko. The newcomer was quite tiny, only about half</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:500.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Geronimo's size, and a very delicate pearly pink with large and lustrous eyes. Geronimo took up his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:529.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the task of insect-hunting with immense concentration, completely ignoring each other. I thought at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:544.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">first that the newcomer, being so dainty, was Geronimo's bride, but investigation in the zinnia bed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:558.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">proved that he still maintained a bachelor establishment under his stone. The new gecko apparently</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:573.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">slept elsewhere, appearing only at night to join Geronimo as he shinned up the wall to the bedroom. In</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:602.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">this newcomer. I toyed with the idea that it might be Geronimo's son or daughter, but I knew that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:616.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">geckos had no family life whatsoever, simply laying their eggs and leaving the young (when hatched) to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:631.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">fend for themselves, so this did not seem probable. I was still undecided as to what name I should</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:645.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">bestow on this new inhabitant of my bedroom when it met with a dreadful fate.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:156.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">horrified by the whole incident and mortified to feel that it was my fault. I hastily gathered up the toads</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:273.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that was, I felt sure, a unique discovery. I even wondered if they might turn out to be something quite</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:288.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">new to science. Hopefully I kept them imprisoned under my bed until the following Thursday, when</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:302.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Theodore arrived. Then I rushed breathlessly up to the bedroom and brought them down for him to see.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:320.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">found him very nice, and that I was sure we should become firm friends. To the query as to what we had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:335.01px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">studied during our first morning I replied, with a certain amount of honesty, that the morning had been</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:349.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">devoted to ornithology and botany.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:371.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The family seemed satisfied. But I very soon found that Mr. Kralefsky was a stickler for work, and he had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:386.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">made up his mind to educate me in spite of any ideas I might have on the subject. The lessons were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:400.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">boring to a degree, for he employed a method of teaching that must have been in fashion round about</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:415.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the middle of the eighteenth century. History was served in great, indigestible chunks, and the dates</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:429.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">were learnt by heart. We would sit and repeat them in a monotonous, sing-song chorus, until they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:444.47px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">became like some incantation that we chanted automatically, our minds busy with other things. For</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:458.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">geography I was confined, to my annoyance, to the British Isles, and innumerable maps had to be traced</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:473.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and filled in with the bevies of counties and the county towns. Then the counties and the towns had to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:487.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">be learnt by heart, together with the names of the important rivers, the main produce of places, the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:502.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">populations, and much other dreary and completely useless information.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:524.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">‘Somerset?' he would trill, pointing at me accusingly.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:547.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I would frown in a desperate attempt to remember something about that county.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:643.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">As far as I was concerned they did not produce anything in Warwick, but I would hazard a wild guess at</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:695.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">answer to be correct. Kralefsky's anguish at my mistakes was very real; the day I informed him that</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:55.00px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Once a week we tortured ourselves by devoting a morning to French. Kralefsky spoke French beautifully,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:69.52px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and to hear me massacring the language was almost more than he could bear. He very soon found that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">it was quite useless to try to teach me from the normal textbooks, so these were set aside in favour of a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:113.10px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">reading the description of the robin's plumage for the twentieth time, a look of grim determination</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:127.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">would settle on Kralefsky's face. He would slam the book shut, rush out into the hall, to reappear a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:142.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">minute later wearing a jaunty panama.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:267.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">So, in almost complete silence, we would wend our way through the town. The beauty of these walks</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:281.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was that, no matter which direction we set out in, we invariably found ourselves, somehow or other, in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:296.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the bird market. We were rather like Alice in the Lookingglass garden: no matter how determinedly we</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:311.01px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">strode off in the opposite direction, in no time at all we found ourselves in the little square where the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:325.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">stalls were piled high with wicker cages and the air rang with the song of birds. Here French would be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:339.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">forgotten; it would fade away into the limbo to join algebra, geometry, history dates, county towns, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:354.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">similar subjects. Our eyes sparkling, our faces flushed, we would move from stall to stall, examining the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:368.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">birds carefully and bargaining fiercely with the vendors, and gradually our arms would become laden</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:383.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">with cages.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:405.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Then we would be brought suddenly back to earth by the watch in Kralefsky's waistcoat pocket, chiming</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:523.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">So we would hurry across the square, pile our twittering, fluttering purchases into a cab, and be driven</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:537.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">back to Kralefsky's house, the jingle of the harness and the thud of hooves mingling pleasantly with the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:552.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">cries of our bird cargo.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:574.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I had worked for some weeks with Kralefsky before I discovered that he did not live alone.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:597.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">At intervals during the morning he would pause suddenly, in the middle of a sum or a recitation of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:611.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">county towns, and cock his head on one side, as if listening.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:634.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Excuse me a moment,' he would say. 'I must go and see Mother.'</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:656.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">At first this rather puzzled me, for I was convinced that Kralefsky was far too old to have a mother still</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:671.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">living. After considerable thought, I came to the conclusion that this was merely his polite way of saying</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:685.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that he wished to retire to the lavatory, for I realized that not everyone shared my family's lack of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:700.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">embarrassment when discussing this topic. It never occurred to me that, if this was so, Kralefsky</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:714.74px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">closeted himself more often than any other human being I had met. One morning I had consumed for</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:342.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">end of the room was an enormous bed, and in it, propped up on a heap of pillows, lay a tiny figure not</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:357.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">much bigger than a child. She must have been very old, I decided as we drew nearer, for her fine,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:293.01px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'I wonder if I might have some water?' he said faintly.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:315.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">At this moment Margo returned with the brandy, and we made Kralefsky take some. A little colour came</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:366.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">trustworthy indication. I knew an artist who fell off a ladder and broke his back, and he was walking</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:619.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">It was Kralefsky's big moment. He smiled a smile of pain-racked nonchalance and waved a hand feebly.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:113.10px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">such quivering intensity that it was unbearable. Strangely enough, her leg never seemed to worry her</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:294.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">she would never see Mother again, Dodo went into mourning and waddled, howling sorrowfully, round</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:309.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the house, occasionally being so overcome with grief that her leg would come out of joint. She greeted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:323.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Mother's return with incredulous joy, but made up her mind that from that moment she would not let</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:352.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of a limpet, never moving more than a couple of feet away at the most. If Mother sat down, Dodo would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:367.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">lie at her feet; if Mother had to get up</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:389.85px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and cross the room for a book or a cigarette, Dodo would accompany her, and then they would return</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:404.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">together and sit down again, Dodo giving a deep sigh of satisfaction at the thought that once more she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:418.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">had foiled Mother's attempts at escape. She even insisted in being present when Mother had a bath,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:433.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">sitting dolefully by the tub and staring at Mother</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:455.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">with embarrassing intensity. Any attempts to leave her outside the bathroom door resulted in Dodo</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:470.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">howling madly and hurling herself at the door-panels, which almost invariably resulted in her hip</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:484.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">slipping out of its socket. She seemed to be under the impression that it was not safe to let Mother go</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:499.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">alone into the bathroom, even if she stood guard over the door. There was always the possibility, she</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:565.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">seemed to bring on an attack of persecution mania, and Dodo would gallop back to the house, howling</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:579.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">for protection. Taken all round they were inclined to consider her a boring and useless addition to the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:503.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">We always visited the lake at this time, for the experience was a memorable one. Not long after Dodo</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:374.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">providing that Leslie came down and had a look at him first. So the next morning I went fishing with</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:178.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">As always, we had decided to give the party at a moment's notice, and for no other reason than that we</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:193.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">suddenly felt like it. Overflowing with the milk of human kindness, the family had invited everyone they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:208.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">could think of, including people they cordially disliked.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:230.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Everyone threw themselves into the preparations with enthusiasm. Since it was early September we</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:244.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">decided to call it a Christmas party, and, in order that the whole thing should not be too straightforward,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:259.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">we invited our guests to lunch, as well as to tea and dinner. This meant the preparation of a vast</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:288.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and stayed there for hours at a time. Even when she did emerge, her spectacles misted with steam, it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:302.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was almost impossible to conduct a conversation with her that was not confined exclusively to food.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:339.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">started organizing so far in advance, and with such zest, that by the time the day of the festivities</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:383.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and sent our carefully arranged plans careering off on a completely different track from the one we had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:397.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">anticipated. We had, over the years, become used to this, which is just as well, for otherwise our</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:412.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Christmas party would have been doomed from the outset, for it was almost completely taken over by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:426.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the animals. It all started, innocently enough, with goldfish.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:449.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I had recently captured, with the aid of Kosti, the ancient terrapin I called Old Plop. To have obtained</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:463.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">such a regal and interesting addition to my collection of pets made me feel that I should do something</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:478.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">to commemorate the event. The best thing would be, I decided, to reorganize my terrapin pond, which</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:492.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was merely an old tin wash-tub. I felt it was far too lowly a hovel for such a creature as Old Plop to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:507.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">inhabit, so I obtained a large, square stone tank (which had once been used as an olive oil store) and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:521.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">proceeded to furnish it artistically</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:544.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">with rocks, water-plants, sand, and shingle. When completed it looked most natural, and the terrapins</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:558.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and watersnakes seemed to approve. However, I was not quite satisfied. The whole thing, though</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:573.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">undeniably a remarkable effort, seemed to lack something. After considerable thought I came to the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:587.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">conclusion that what it needed to add the final touch was goldfish. The problem was, where to get</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:602.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">them? The nearest place to purchase such a thing would be Athens, but this would be a complicated</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:616.79px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">business, and, moreover, take time. I wanted my pond to be complete for the day of the party. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:631.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">family were, I knew, too occupied to be able to devote any time to the task of obtaining goldfish, so I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:645.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">took my problem to Spiro. He, after I had described in graphic detail what goldfish were, said that he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:660.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">thought my request was impossible; he had never come across any such fish in Corfu.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:682.82px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Anyway, he said he would see what he could do. There was a long period of waiting, during which I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:697.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">thought he had forgotten, and then, the day before the party, he beckoned me into a quiet corner, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:711.74px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">looked around to make sure we were not overheard.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:113.10px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">being a remarkable achievement. It also considerably enhanced the prestige of the fish as far as I was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:150.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">It was on the morning of the party that things really started to happen. To begin with, Mother</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:164.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">discovered that Dodo had chosen this day, of all days, to come into season. One of the peasant girls had</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:244.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">killed and partially eaten. In my delight at getting the fish, I had forgotten that both terrapins and the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:259.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">water-snakes were partial to a plump fish occasionally. So I was forced to move the reptiles into</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:399.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">picking up the tin I rushed into the house. Mother was in the kitchen, harassed and absent-minded,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:510.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I filled the bath with nice cool water and placed the snakes tenderly inside; in a few minutes they</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:288.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Dreadful, by Jove,' exclaimed Kralefsky, his eyes wide. 'She might have been killed.'</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:311.01px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Yes, she might,' agreed Larry. 'As it was, it completely ruined my holiday.'</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:333.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Did she recover?' asked Kralefsky. It was obvious that he was planning a thrilling Infuriated Bee</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:347.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Adventure that he could have with his lady.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:370.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Oh, yes, after a few weeks in hospital,' Larry replied carelessly. 'It didn't seem to put her off bees</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:384.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">though. Shortly afterwards a whole flock of them swarmed in the chimney, and in trying to smoke them</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:436.41px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Dreadful, dreadful,' murmured Kralefsky.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:458.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Theodore, meticulously buttering a piece of bread, gave a tiny grunt of amusement. He popped the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:473.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">bread into his mouth, chewed it solidly for a minute or so, swallowed, and wiped his beard carefully on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:487.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">his napkin.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:510.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'Talking of fires,' he began, his eyes alight with impish humour, 'did I tell you about the time the Corfu</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:524.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Fire Brigade was modernized? It seems that the Chief of the fire service had been to Athens and had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:539.39px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">been greatly ... er ... impressed by the new fire-fighting equipment there. He felt it was high time that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:553.91px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Corfu got rid of its horse-drawn fire engine and should obtain a new one. .. um ... preferably a nice, shiny</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:568.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">red one. There were several other improvements he had thought of as well. He came back here alight</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:582.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">with... um . . . with enthusiasm. The first thing he did was to cut a round hole in the ceiling of the fire</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:597.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">station, so that the firemen could slide down a pole in the correct manner. It appears that in his haste to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:611.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">become modernized he forgot the pole, and so the first time they had a. practice two of the firemen</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:626.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">broke their legs.'</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:648.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'No, Theodore, I refuse to believe that. It couldn't be true.'</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:671.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'No, no, I assure you it's perfectly true. They brought the men to my laboratory to be Xrayed.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:693.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Apparently what had happened was that the Chief had not explained to the men about the pole, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:708.26px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">they thought they had to jump down the hole. That was only the beginning. At quite considerable cost</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:722.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">an extremely ... er ... large fire engine was purchased.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:745.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The Chief insisted on the biggest and best. Unfortunately it was so big that there was only one way they</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:84.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">thought, was the business about the very modern fire alarm the Chief had sent for: you know, it was one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:98.58px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of those ones where you break the glass and there is a little sort of... um ... telephone inside. Well, there</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:113.10px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was a great argument as to where they should put this. The Chief told me that it was a very</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:135.54px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">difficult thing to decide, as they were not sure where the fires were going to break out. So, in order to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:150.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">avoid any confusion, they fixed the fire alarm on the door of the fire station.'</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:172.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Theodore paused, rasped his beard with his thumb, and took a sip of wine.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:195.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">'They had hardly got things organized before they had their first fire. Fortunately I happened to be in the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:238.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Then there were angry words exchanged, it seems, because the Chief was annoyed at having his fire</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:253.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">alarm broken so soon. He told the man that he should have knocked on the door; the fire alarm was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:267.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">brand new, and it would take weeks to replace the glass. Eventually the fire engine was wheeled out</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:281.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">into the street and the firemen assembled. The Chief made a short speech, urging each man to do his ...</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:304.53px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">um... duty. Then they took their places. There was a bit of a fuss about who should have the honour of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:318.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">ringing the bell, but eventually the Chief did the job himself. I must say that when the engine did arrive it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:333.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">looked very impressive. They all leapt off and bustled about, and looked very efficient. They uncoiled a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:85.10px;top:362.49px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">to unlock the back of the engine so that the hose could be attached. The Chief said he had given it to</span></div>
